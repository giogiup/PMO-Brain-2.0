**VERSION: 1.1**
****This runs after the Daily Mon-Fri ) extract*****

Score all unscored articles in PMO database using MCP. Process in batches of 20 until complete.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. MUST have BOTH PMO + AI intersection. NO AI = 1-20 maximum, regardless of PMO relevance
2. Traditional PM/productivity without AI = 10-20 (useful but not relevant)
3. Infrastructure/hardware (chips, data centers, cloud) = 10-20 (not PMO relevant)
4. AI agents for workflow automation = 70-80 (very relevant)
5. Model selection, benchmarks, tool evaluation for PMO use = 60-70
6. General business AI (not PMO-specific) = 20-35
7. AI-POWERED Office Productivity (Copilot, AI assistants in Excel/Word/PowerPoint, AI note-taking, AI meeting tools) = 75-90
   Must explicitly mention AI features. Look for: AI, machine learning, GPT, Claude, Copilot, intelligent, smart assistant
   Traditional Office automation without AI = 10-20
8. Consumer products, gaming, news, politics = 1
9. EVERY article gets score 1-100. Never leave pmo_score NULL or 0

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:
AI for PMO - articles without AI are irrelevant regardless of PMO utility

SCORING SCALE:
85-100: Essential AI+PMO
70-84: Highly relevant AI+PMO
50-69: Moderate AI+PMO
30-49: Low relevance
10-29: Minimal relevance
1-9: No relevance

EXAMPLES HIGH SCORE:
Excel with Copilot AI = 75-90
AI meeting notes = 75-90
ChatGPT for project planning = 75-90
AI workflow agents = 70-80

EXAMPLES LOW SCORE:
Excel formulas no AI = 10-20
Traditional PM no AI = 10-20
PowerPoint templates no AI = 10-20
Infrastructure news = 10-20
Consumer products = 1

PROCESS:
1. SELECT id, title, content_summary FROM daily_insights WHERE pmo_score IS NULL OR pmo_score = 0 LIMIT 20
2. Score all 20 silently
3. Bulk UPDATE with CASE for all 20 including prompt version
4. Show: Batch X complete: 20 scored
5. Repeat until none unscored
6. Final summary

SQL FORMAT:
UPDATE daily_insights 
SET pmo_score = CASE id WHEN id1 THEN score1 WHEN id2 THEN score2 END,
    pmo_application = CASE id WHEN id1 THEN reason1 WHEN id2 THEN reason2 END,
    scoring_prompt_version = '1.1'
WHERE id IN (id1,id2,...)

FINAL SUMMARY:
Total scored
Count by range (85-100, 70-84, 50-69, 30-49, 1-29)
