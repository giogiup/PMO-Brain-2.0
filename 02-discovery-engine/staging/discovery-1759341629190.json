      "summary": "Mars isn't our only neighbor that may harbor life. The odds have risen that Saturn's moon Enceladus may, too. On Wednesday, scientists published a paper outlining the increasing complexity of molecules emitted from beneath the moon's surface. \"We now have all elements required for Enceladus to harbour life,\" the ESA's Dr Jörn Helbert told The Guardian.\nEnceladus gives researchers a unique window into its subsurface world. The Cassini mission already taught us that plumes of water ice shoot 6,000 miles into space from Enceladus. The source of those icy jets is believed to be a subsurface saltwater ocean, around 30 miles deep, that envelops the entire moon. The space geysers shoot out from its South Pole.\n\nPrevious analysis of the moon's icy particles already revealed the chemical building blocks for life as we know it. But before, the organics were inferred from studying Saturn's E ring, which is composed mostly of material from the icy jet. In contrast, this study looked at data from the Cassini mission's flyby of the plumes themselves. What's different today is the variety of organic signatures and the freshness of the samples. \"These grains were just minutes old,\" lead author Dr. Nozair Khawaja told The Guardian.\n\nNASA / JPL / Space Science Institute\n\n\"The detection of organics directly in the plume rules out space weathering as the sole production pathway,\" the paper's authors wrote. Space weathering refers to radiation and other processes that potentially alter or spoil the samples. \"The grains are fresh, unaltered and proof of survival through ocean transit and plume emission\" for the compounds.\n\"These grains were just minutes old,\" Khawaja said. \"It means that what we are capturing here is actually the pure sample from the subsurface.\" He said the results also increased the known complexity of Enceladus' sub-surface organic chemistry. \"When there is complexity happening, that means that the habitable potential of Enceladus is increasing right now,\" he said.\nThe results still don't prove that there's life on Saturn's moon. However, they do suggest a chemically rich subsurface ocean that could seed the building blocks of life. Your move, Mars.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/saturns-ocean-moon-looks-more-hospitable-to-subsurface-life-than-we-thought-174149814.html?src=rss",

Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work.\n  \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more.\n \nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors.\n \nShark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty.\n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \nDyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $500 (24 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in.\n \nAmazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $55 (21 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean.\n \nBlack+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-robot-vacuum-deals-you-can-get-now-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504093.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Xbox owners got a bit of a nasty surprise thanks to Microsoft’s sudden announcement today that the monthly cost of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription is getting a 50 percent increase. The new $30 monthly price, up from $20, is going to really sting for a lot of people, especially with no cheaper annual or quarterly options offered.\nFortunately, the rough price hike isn’t all that Microsoft talked about today — there are a lot of games being added to the service, particularly for the two most expensive plans. In case you aren’t up to date, Game Pass is now split into three slightly revamped tiers: Essential, Premium and Ultimate, two of which are confusingly also names Sony uses for its cheapest and most expensive PS Plus offerings. You can read a full breakdown of each tier and what they cost here.\n\nMore than 45 new games have joined the Ultimate library, with certain Ultimate games trickling down into the Premium and Essential tiers. If that sounds confusing, that’s probably because it is, but the main headlines are that Hogwarts Legacy is now part of Game Pass Ultimate and Premium, while the priciest Ultimate lineup has ballooned in size thanks to the introduction of Ubisoft Classics+. This curated catalogue of Ubisoft’s extensive back catalogue joins EA Play, which was already part of Ultimate, and is a pretty significant addition to the service.

      "summary": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference to intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to core operating system functions. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only are these some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time thanks to Amazon Prime Day.\n \nBest October Prime Day SSD deals\n \n \n \nCrucial T500 1TB for $89 (38 percent off): We named the Crucial T500 one of the best SSDs for PS5 and still stand by that rating. This 1TB model can hit read speeds of 7,300MB/s, more than enough for optimal performance per Sony's specs. You can even install it at home with no tools more complicated than a screwdriver.\n  \nCrucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD, but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s — all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case.\n \nSamsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use.\n \nSamsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.\n \nKingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $89 (23 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height.\n \nSanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $148 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters.\n \nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $220 (39 percent off): This SeaGate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-october-prime-day-ssd-deals-discounts-on-gear-from-crucial-samsung-and-more-170039440.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "T-Mobile just announced that its T-Satellite with Starlink service now integrates with several apps. These include AllTrails, AccuWeather, X, WhatsApp and several others. Certain native apps also now integrate with the service, like Google Messages, Apple Music and Samsung's weather app.\nIt's important to note that users won't always have access to the full app experience here, as satellite connectivity is limited. Some features may be limited and everything is likely to be noticeably slower. Still, being able to look at a map on AllTrails while actually on a trail in the middle of nowhere will be incredibly useful. It'll be less useful to read some random screed on X while sitting next to the campfire, but whatever gets you through the night.\n\nT-Mobile \n\nT-Mobile promises that WhatsApp will allow for \"sending voice notes, sharing photos or even calling your entire group chat.\" This is a potential game-changer but it really depends on how slow everything is, which we won't know until some explorers get out there to put the app through its paces.\nThe company has also integrated a number of business-focused apps into T-Satellite for those subscribed to the SuperMobile or T-Priority plans. These apps include the communications platform MultiLine and the AI-powered messaging service Dialpad.\n\nT-Satellite uses Starlink satellites to provide coverage in remote parts of the world. It became broadly available back in July after months of testing. The service is available for both Android and iOS devices. It's free for T-Mobile customers but everyone else can sign up for $10 a month.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/t-mobiles-starlink-satellite-service-now-works-with-a-handful-of-apps-165732659.html?src=rss",

      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "Microsoft has announced some major changes for Game Pass. It’s rebranding some of the tiers, which should make it a little easier to keep tabs on what games and features are available on Game Pass across Xbox consoles, PC and cloud gaming. \nHowever, there is a painful price increase here. The high-end plan, Game Pass Ultimate, now costs $30 per month — 50 percent more than the previous $20 per month. and there’s no annual or quarterly option available to make that sting less.\nThat means the price of a Game Pass Ultimate membership has nearly doubled in 15 months. Microsoft previously raised the price from $17 to $20 in July 2024. The latest change now means that, at $360 per year, Game Pass Ultimate is now more than twice as expensive as PlayStation Plus Premium, which is currently $160 on an annual plan. \nMicrosoft recently announced a price increase for its Xbox Series X/S consoles as well. The systems will be more expensive to buy in the US starting this Friday. Also, pre-orders for the ROG Xbox Ally handheld just went live, with Microsoft confirming that the higher-end model would cost $1,000.  PC Game Pass is going up from $12 per month to $16.50 too. It’s getting really expensive to be an Xbox fan, folks.\nA breakdown of the Xbox Game Pass tiers.\nXbox\n\nIn fairness, along with a price increase, Microsoft is expanding  Game Pass Ultimate in other ways. It’s adding more than 45 games to that tier today, including a whole bunch of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry titles, as well as other Ubisoft games. That’s due, in large part, to Microsoft adding Ubisoft+ (which costs about $16 per month) to Game Pass Ultimate today. \nOn November 18, Ultimate members will get Fortnite Crew as part of their subscription. That gives players access to the Fortnite battle pass, 1,000 V-Bucks added to their account each month and other perks. That usually costs $12 per month, so the Game Pass Ultimate price increase might actually work out in some Fortnite players’ favor — if they ever stop playing it long enough to check out other games and get more value for their $30 per month.\nMicrosoft also notes that Ultimate subscribers will be able to play more than 75 day one games (i.e. those that join the service on their release day) every year across Xbox consoles, PC and Xbox Cloud Gaming. That works out to at least six per month, on average. The Ultimate library now includes more than 400 games, including titles from EA Play. \nAs part of these changes, Xbox Cloud Gaming is officially out of beta and Ultimate subscribers have access to what Microsoft claims is its highest-quality streaming option with the lowest wait times. They’ll be able to earn up to $100 worth of rewards per year by playing games too.\nMicrosoft can talk up the new Ultimate features as much as it likes, but there’s no denying that a 50 percent price increase is a heck of a jump. Of note, games news curator Wario64 pointed out that the Game Pass cancellation web page appears to be overloaded:\n\nthe website to cancel Xbox Game Pass subscriptions is overloaded https://t.co/tnUjhmg1GS pic.twitter.com/vLzPsodAdf\n— Wario64 (@Wario64) October 1, 2025\nThere are changes afoot on the other two main Game Pass tiers. Standard subscribers are moving over to Premium, and Game Pass Core members will be on an Essential plan. (Essential and Premium are the same names PlayStation uses for the base and high-end PS Plus plans, fact fans.) Those tiers aren’t getting price increases, as Premium will run you $15 per month and Essential is still $10. \nPremium and Essential now include PC games. The Premium plan includes more than 200 games, all of which are playable on consoles and PC. Microsoft added more than 40 to the Premium library today, including Diablo IV and Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. \nThe company said that Xbox-published games will hit the Premium tier within a year of their release, but not that doesn’t include Call of Duty titles. This tier includes in-game perks for the likes of League of Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X, as well as the option to stream some games you own via the cloud and the ability to earn up to $50 per year in rewards.\nAs with the other two tiers, the Essential plan now includes “unlimited cloud gaming” (though perhaps with longer wait times), online multiplayer access and in-game perks for certain titles. It has a library of 50-plus games and the ability to earn up to $25 in annual rewards through playing games.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html?src=rss",

      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in.\n \nYes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service.\n  \nBest streaming deals\n \nTrue streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\n \nIf you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\n \n \n \nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\n \nFubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\n \nDirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.\n \nYouTube TV (three months) for $219 ($30 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once.\n \nDashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\n \nPeacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\n \nStudent discounts on streaming services\n \nHBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\n \nHulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well.\n \nSpotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\n \nNBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\n \nStreaming bundle discounts\n \nThere’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\n \nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option.\n \nAlso, it's worth noting that anything Disney-related will be getting a price hike soon. As of October 21, 2025, you'll pay more for Disney+, Hulu and most associated bundles. But if you subscribe now, you'll at least pay one month at the old, cheaper rate.\n \n \n \nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\n \nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\n \nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\n \nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\n \nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\n \nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\n \nRead more streaming coverage\n \n \n \nThe best live TV streaming services to cut cable\n \n \nThe best streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and more\n \n \nThe best streaming devices\n \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Muscle-Bound Micromirrors Could Bring Lidar to More Cars",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-lidar",
      "summary": "Five years ago, Eric Aguilar was fed up.\nHe had worked on lidar and other sensors for years at Tesla and Google X, but the technology always seemed too expensive and, more importantly, unreliable. He replaced the lidar sensors when they broke—which was all too often, and seemingly at random—and developed complex calibration methods and maintenance routines just to keep them functioning and the cars drivable.\nSo, when he reached the end of his rope, he invented a more robust technology—what he calls the “most powerful micromachine ever made.”\nAguilar and his team at startup Omnitron Sensors developed new micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology that he claims can produce more force per unit area than any other. By supplying new levels of power to micromirrors, the technology is capable of precisely steering lidar’s laser beams, even while weathering hazardous elements and the bumps and bangs of the open road. With chips under test by auto-industry customers, Omnitron is now modifying the technology to reduce the power consumed by AI data centers.\nLidar, a scanning and detection system that uses lasers to determine how far away objects are, is often adopted by self-driving cars to find obstacles and navigate. Even as the market for lidar is expected to grow by 13.6 percent annually, lidar use in the automotive industry has remained relatively stagnant in recent years, Aguilar says, in part because the technology’s lifespan is so short. \nVibration from bumpy roads and severe environmental conditions are the biggest reliability killers for automotive lidar, says Mo Li, who studies photonic systems at the University of Washington. The optical alignment within the lidar package atop self-driving cars is delicate—tremors from a poor paving job could physically alter where the mirrors sit in the housing, potentially misaligning the beam and causing the system to fail. Or temperature fluctuations could cause parts to expand or contract with the same unfortunate outcome, he explains.\nAguilar wondered which part broke most often and found the culprit to be scanners, the parts responsible for angling small mirrors that direct the laser beam out of the system’s housing. He wanted to make scanners that could withstand the tough conditions lidar faces, and silicon flexures stood out as a solution. These structures act like springs and allow for meticulous control of the mirrors within lidar systems without wearing out, as the standard metal springs do, Aguilar claims.\nDesigning a better chip\nAguilar hoped the new material would be the answer to the problem that plagued him, but even silicon springs didn’t make lidar systems as robust as they needed to be to withstand the elements they faced.\nTo make lidar even stronger, the team at Omnitron aimed to design a more powerful MEMS chip by increasing the amount of force the device can apply to control the mirrors in the lidar array. And they claim to have achieved it—their chip can exert 10 times more force per unit area on an actuator that positions a micromirror or other sensor component than the current industry standard, they say. That extra force allows for extremely valuable control in fine adjustment. \nTo reach this achievement, they had to dig deep—literally. \n  Omnitron’s micromirrors steer lidar beams and could find use in data centers.Omnitron\nIn this MEMS device, the mirror and its actuator are etched into a single silicon wafer. On its non-mirror end, the actuator is covered with tiny, closely spaced plates that fit between trenches in the wafer, like the interlocking teeth of two combs. To move the mirror, voltage is applied, and electrostatic forces angle the mirror into a specific position by moving the plates up and down within the trenches as the electric field pulls across the trench sidewalls. \nThe force that can be used to move the mirror is limited by the ratio of depth to width of the trenches, called aspect ratio. Put simply, the deeper the trenches are, the more electrostatic force can be applied to an actuator, which  leads to a higher range of motion for the sensor. But fabricating deep, narrow trenches is a difficult endeavor. Overcoming this limiting factor was a must for Aguilar. \nAguilar says Omnitron was able to improve on the around 20:1 aspect ratio he notes is typical for MEMS (other experts say 30:1 or 40:1 is closer to average these days) , reaching up to 100:1 through experimentation and prototyping in small university foundries across the United States “That’s really our core breakthrough,” Aguilar says. “It was through blood, sweat, tears, and frustration that we started this company.”\nThe startup has secured over $800 million in letters of intent from automotive partners, Aguilar says, and is two months into an 18 month plan to prove that it can produce its chips at full demand rate. \nEven after verifying production capabilities, the technology will have to face “very tough” safety testing for thousands of consecutive hours in realistic conditions, like vibrations, thermal cycles, and rain, before it can come to market, Li says.\nSaving power\nIn the meantime, Omnitron is applying its technology to solve a different problem faced by a different industry. By 2030, AI data centers are expected to require around 945 terawatt hours to function—more than the country of Japan consumes today. The problem is “the way data moves,” Aguilar says. When data is sent from one part of the data center to another, optical signals are converted into electrical signals, rerouted, and then turned back to optical signals to be sent on their way. This process, which takes place in systems called network switches, burns huge amounts of power.\nGoogle’s solution, called Apollo, is to keep the data packets in the form of optical signals for the duration of their travels, which yields a 40 percent power savings, the company claims. Apollo does so by using an array of mirrors to direct the data. Aguilar is planning to make the process even more efficient using dense arrays of Omnitron’s more powerful mirrors. Doing so could quadruple the amount of data each network switch could route by increasing the number of channels in each switch from 126 to 441, Aguilar says.\nOmnitron is still early in its data center implementation, so it’s not yet clear to what degree this technology can really improve on Google’s Apollo. However, following a “critical design review” in mid-September, “one of the world’s top AI hyperscalers has requested our mirrors for their next generation switch,” Aguilar says. “This is proof that Omnitron solves a problem that even the biggest AI infrastructure companies can’t address in house.”\nAnd there may be even more applications to come. Omnitron has received feelers from the defense industry, space companies, and groups interested in methane detection, says Aguilar. “It’s pretty cool seeing the people knock on our door for this because I was just focusing on lidar,” he says.",

      "title": "AI Expands the Search for New Battery Materials",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-battery-material",
      "summary": "When Microsoft researchers in 2023 identified a new kind of material that could dramatically reduce the amount of lithium needed in rechargeable batteries, it felt like combing through a haystack in record time. That’s because their discovery began as 32 million possibilities and, with the help of artificial intelligence, produced a promising candidate within 80 hours. \nNow researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory plan to synthesize and test the novel material, NaxLi3−xYCl6,  in a battery setup. It’s one of several AI-generated battery chemistries making its way to the real world.\nMicrosoft’s experiment started when the researchers wanted to demonstrate how AI could tackle the needle-in-a-haystack problem of finding useful new materials and chemicals. They decided to seek new candidates for a rechargeable battery’s electrolyte, because a better electrolyte could make batteries safer while simultaneously improving performance, says Nathan Baker, project leader at Microsoft for Azure Quantum Elements, a program to accelerate chemistry and materials research through Microsoft’s advanced computing and AI platforms.\n“Our goal was to take one of these AI models and show the promise of accelerating scientific discovery—sifting through 32.5 million materials candidates and showing that we could do it in a matter of hours, not years,” Baker says. Their model, called the M3GNet framework, accelerated simulations of molecular dynamics to evaluate properties of the materials such as atomic diffusivity.\nFirst, the Microsoft researchers asked the model to drop new chemical elements into known crystalline structures in nature and determine which resulting molecules would be stable, a step that cut the 32 million starting candidates down to half a million. AI then screened those materials based on the necessary chemical abilities to make a battery work, which chopped the pool to just 800. From there, traditional computing and old-fashioned human expertise identified the novel material that could function within a battery and use 70 percent less lithium than the rechargeable batteries in commercial use today.\nAI’s Role in Next-Gen Battery Design\nThe Microsoft team isn’t alone. Around the world, researchers are busy trying to develop next-generation designs to replace or improve lithium-ion batteries, which use large quantities of rare, expensive, and difficult-to-acquire elements. New battery designs could use more abundant materials, reduce the fire danger from lithium-based liquid electrolytes, and pack more energy into a smaller space. The chemistries to do this are waiting out there to be discovered, and increasingly, researchers are harnessing AI and machine learning to do the work of sorting through the mountain of data. \n“We are teaching AI how to be a materials scientist,” says Dibakar Datta, associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, who published a study in August that used AI to identify five candidate materials for batteries that would outperform Li-ion. Datta’s team is working on the multivalent battery: one that employs multivalent ions that can carry multiple charge levels as opposed to the single charge carried by a lithium battery. \nThis would give the battery a greater energy storage capacity, but it also means working with larger ions from elements higher on the periodic table, like magnesium and calcium. Those larger ions won’t necessarily fit into existing battery designs without cracking or breaking the elements, Datta says. His new study used what he calls a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) that could propose new materials, and a large language model (LLM) that could find materials that would be the most stable in the real world. From a pool of millions of possibilities, the approach found five porous materials of the right size that could do the job.\nGuiding an AI model on its hunt through the nearly infinite space of possible materials is the tipping point in this field. The key to using it as a research partner is to find a happy medium between a model that works fast and a model that delivers perfectly accurate results, says Austin Sendek, professor at Stanford University who has developed algorithms to help AI discover new battery materials. \n“You have to traverse both breadth and depth,” says Sendek. Depth, because designing these things takes a lot of deep scientific knowledge about properties, engineering and chemistry, and breadth, because you have to apply that knowledge across an infinite chemical space, he says. “That’s where the promise of AI comes in.” \nAI Battery Technology Search at IBM\nResearchers at IBM have taken an AI-driven approach to identify new electrolyte candidates, which involved identifying chemical formulations with far higher electric conductivity than the lithium salts used in current batteries. A typical electrolyte can contain six to eight ingredients including salts, solvents, and additives, and it’s nearly impossible to consider all the combinations without AI. \nTo whittle down the field, the IBM team developed chemical foundation models trained on billions of molecules. “They capture the basic language of chemistry,” says Young-Hye Na, Principal Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Her team then trains those models with battery-related data so the AI can predict important properties for battery applications on scales from individual molecules all the way up to a whole device. Na described the work in a paper published in August in NPJ Computational Materials.\nBecause the work investigates new combinations of existing materials rather than using AI to invent exotic new materials, its potential to help build the battery of tomorrow is that much more promising, Na says. The IBM team is now collaborating with an undisclosed EV manufacturer to design high-performance electrolytes for high-voltage batteries.\nIBM’s use of AI for batteries isn’t limited to the hunt for promising materials. Typically, when AI reveals a promising new material, the next step is for experimentalists to synthesize the stuff, experiment with it in the lab, and one day to test it in a real device. Machine learning (ML) will aid researchers in this testing step, too. \nIBM is testing the real-world viability of new battery setups by building their digital twins—virtual models that allow the researchers to predict how a particular battery chemistry would degrade over a lifetime of countless power cycles. The model, developed in collaboration with battery startup Sphere Energy, can predict a battery’s long-term behavior in as few as 50 power cycles modeled on the digital twin, says Teodoro Laino, distinguished research staff member at IBM Research.\nQuantum Computing Batteries\nThe next phase of AI battery research is quantum. As Microsoft and IBM push toward the potential of quantum computers, both see its promise to model complex chemistry with no shortcuts or compromises. Na says that while current AI is a crucial tool for investigating battery chemistry, the next step—modeling whole EV battery packs, for example, and taking into consideration all the variables they encounter in the real world—would require the power of quantum computing. \nAs Baker puts it: “We know classical computers have problems generating accurate answers for complex substances, complex molecules, complex materials. So our goal right now is actually to change the way the data is generated by bringing quantum into the loop so that we have higher accuracy data for training ML models.”",

      "summary": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by IP.com\nAround the world, innovation is no longer just a function of invention. It is a strategic asset, deeply linked to economic resilience—and increasingly reliant on ever-evolving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). As intellectual property ecosystems transform under this new reality, the need for advanced, efficient, ethical AI-supported innovation infrastructure has never been more urgent.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has emerged as a global leader in this space, signaling its commitment to responsible AI leadership through the AI and Emerging Technologies (ET) Partnership, and most recently, through its landmark guidance clarifying that human contribution is essential for inventorship in AI-assisted creations and its significant investment in deploying AI to improve prior art searches and overall examination quality.\n  \nAs governments, enterprises, and inventors look to chart a path through this rapidly shifting IP landscape, one innovation intelligence company has been boldly helping lead the way: IP.com.\nFor over 20 years, IP.com has worked to empower public and private innovation stakeholders alike with an ever-expanding suite of AI-powered tools that enhance ideation, evaluate novelty, clarify patent landscapes, and protect inventive work around the globe.\nToday, as the world rethinks how to balance open innovation with strategic security, IP.com’s solutions are not only timely—they are essential.\n\nAligning A National Vision with Global Innovation \nWhile each country faces its own innovation challenges and opportunities, there is a growing consensus around one idea: the systems that support innovation—including those for AI and intellectual property—must be modern, data-driven, future-ready, and responsible.\nThat vision was echoed in the U.S. government’s recent Executive Order on artificial intelligence (EO 14179), and the newly published “America’s AI Action Plan” which emphasize the need for safe and trustworthy AI systems to drive economic growth and national security. While the Executive Order speaks primarily to U.S. priorities, it reflects a global movement toward building responsible AI systems that deliver long-term value, foster trust, and safeguard the integrity of innovation.\nIP.com’s innovation platforms are deeply aligned with this broader call, providing AI solutions that are secure and responsible from the ground up. From operating in a private environment to being fully ITAR-compliant, IP.com’s approach delivers IP-advancing AI solutions that are safe and accountable so inventors, R&D teams, IP professionals, and federal agencies can work smarter, faster, and more securely.\nShaping the Future of Responsible, Innovation-Supportive AI\nIP.com’s dual-engine AI-fueled Innovation Power (IP) Suite® mirrors how high-performing teams think while aligning closely with the strategies and priorities shaping the future of intellectual property. It responsibly integrates AI into intellectual property processes to foster innovation within a secure, inclusive framework free from ideological bias or hallucinations.\nThe IP Suite is purpose-built to deliver actionable insights grounded in proprietary data. With security integrated at every level—including ITAR compliance and private AI environments—IP.com offers best-in-class capabilities that protect sensitive data while accelerating innovation workflows.

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-milestone",
      "summary": "IEEE Collabratec reached a milestone in August: more than 100,000 IEEE members (plus 250,000 nonmembers) on the online networking platform. To commemorate the achievement, IEEE released a 100,000-member badge for users.\nThe badges recognize members for their participation in IEEE Collabratec’s communities and discussion forums. They also reward users for creating networks with other IEEE members and solving IEEE Puzzlers brainteasers.\n“Since 2021 IEEE Collabratec has been a game-changer in my membership journey,” IEEE Member Jaramogi Khalfani Adofo Odhiambo says. He is a member of the IEEE Uganda Section. “I connect with fellow volunteers around the world and have found mentorship and support for personal growth.\n“Collabratec is more than a network; it’s a vibrant community that celebrates learning, leadership, and collaboration.”\nThe platform was launched in 2015 to help members stay connected with the organization and local sections.\nRolling out new features\nSince its debut, IEEE Collabratec has introduced new features. Here are some recent additions:\n\nThe IEEE Puzzlers community, which premiered in 2021, offers a fun, engaging experience for those who enjoy solving brainteasers such as missing numbers and logic games. There are different levels of difficulty. People who correctly solve the puzzles receive badges and recognition on the website. There are several types of badges, based on how many puzzles users solve. A badge is awarded when participants solve 7, 15, 30, 50, and 75 puzzles. Seventeen community participants from seven countries currently have the highest level badge, which is awarded for solving 555.\nThe IEEE Mentoring Program pairs mentors with members who are seeking guidance on topics such as their career, education, leadership, volunteering, or a particular technical field. The program, created in 2023, is open to IEEE members of any grade. Anyone can be a mentor, whether they’re a student or a seasoned professional. As of July, about 3,700 members have signed up to guide others, a 25 percent increase since last year. There are about 1,300 mentor-mentee pairings now, with IEEE senior members representing half of the mentors. A new community dedicated to mentoring is scheduled to debut this year.\nTo better reflect members’ IEEE contributions, such as leading a committee or organizing an event, digital certificates are offered for volunteering. Each individualized document includes the person’s name, the position they held, and the years served. Every position held has its own certificate. A member’s list of roles is updated annually. Users can download the certificates and add them to their LinkedIn profile or résumé. Certificates also may be printed for displaying.\n\n“IEEE Collabratec has served as a truly unifying force across our global technical community—bridging disciplines, geographies, and generations,” IEEE Life Fellow Fredrick Mintzer says. Mintzer, recipient of the 2022 IEEE Emberson Award, is a frequent Collabratec contributor. “For a decade, Collabratec has embodied the One IEEE philosophy by fostering collaboration and empowering members and nonmembers alike to connect, contribute, discuss, debate, and grow together.”\nTo learn more about IEEE Collabratec, check out the user guide, FAQs, and users’ forum.",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQACeDZuYsB3M9yuB/ai-and-cheap-weapons",
      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 5:31 PM GMT\n\nThis article discusses the \"Proliferation by Default\" dynamic that the falling price of weapons-capable AI systems will create. It covers an array of dangerous capabilities in future systems and comparisons to historical technologies. In the following parts of this series, we will explore the how the price of these offensive AI systems could fall, their strategic implications, and policy solutions.\nSummary of key points:\n\nThere are a number of technologies where even human-level assistance could allow non-state actors to acquire WMDs, especially in the development of bio, chemical, and cyber weapons.\nNarrowly superhuman AI technologies (such as those specialized in biological or robotics engineering) could contribute to the development of cheap superweapons, such as mirror life and autonomous drone swarms.\nGenerally superintelligent AIs would be overwhelmingly strategically impactful, given their major advantages in intelligence, speed, coordination, and scalability compared to humans.\nThrough their strategic superiority, these superintelligent AIs would allow whoever commanded them to gain a dominant strategic advantage over other non-ASI actors. If they cannot be controlled, ASI competition with humanity for resources and agency could lead to either permanent human disempowerment or extinction.\nGiven these strategic realities, proliferation of powerful AI systems is a major national and international security risk, even for non-superintelligent models. \n\nPowerful AI Systems and Weapons\nFor just under a century, world-ending technology has been constrained to nukes and bioweapons, although its easier to credit this to the fact that we haven't yet discovered dangerous new technologies rather than that we chose to avoid building them. Fortunately, both of these weapons have large technical, financial, and logistical barriers, which, when combined with our current nonproliferation efforts, have kept them contained to a few nation-state actors.\nThe defining challenge of the 21st century may be that this will no longer be the case. Just as artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize medicine, the economy, and fundamental research, it similarly promises to accelerate and optimize the development of powerful new weapons. In particular, there are two major concerns:\n\nAI-derived weapons may be extremely destructive.\nThe price of the AI software responsible for weapons design will continue to decline.\n\nTaken together, these dynamics imply that allowing powerful AI systems to proliferate would quickly democratize means of mass destruction, absent preemptive intervention by governments. What these offensive capabilities might look like, and how the costs to acquire them will fall, will be the focus of the first and second parts of this series.\nOffensive AI Capabilities\nWhile AIs themselves could be employed directly as part of weapons systems, their greatest contributions to geopolitical insecurity might be through advanced R&D efforts, discovering cheaper and more lethal ways of causing catastrophic damage. Although some of these capabilites might only emerge once AI systems are generally superintelligent, there are also plenty of more narrow, near-term capabilities that could be equally dangerous. \nBroadly speaking, there are three types of offensive capabilities that AI might assist with. These capabilities might be developed intentionally, as states and other actors pursue strategically relevant weapons technology, or incidentally, as the result of pursuing general capacities in dual-use fields of research.\n\nIncreasing access to existing WMDs\nAssisting with the design of new superweapons\nSuperintelligent AIs as offensive agents\n\nIncreased Access to Existing WMDs \nThe most basic application of powerful AI systems will be their contributions to the manufacturing of existing weapons. Of particular concern are weapons whose costs are mostly bounded by technical expertise rather than physical materials, since AI labor will become increasingly able to provide this technical assistance. Creating an effective bioweapon, for instance, requires extensive technical understanding of methods for cultivation, storage, and dispersal, or else the agent will be inert when deployed. The remaining costs of setting up a functional wet-lab and acquiring an initial agent are paltry enough that even non-state actors can afford them.[1] In comparison, even if you eliminate the cost of sourcing technical assistance from nuclear weapons, you're still faced with the irreducible physical costs of enrichment and large-scale industrial manufacturing. \nThe Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo is emblematic of these issues, both in their determination to use biological weapons and in their persistent challenges in doing so. Despite impressive financial resources, the group's attempts to weaponize botulinum toxin and anthrax were both failures. Although they were successful in cultivating the agents they acquired, they didn't have the technical expertise to distinguish between natural strains of C. botulinum and had cultivated vaccine samples of anthrax, hoping in vain that they would be lethal.[2] There were similar challenges in their pursuit of chemical weapons as well: the sarin nerve gas they used in their attack on the Tokyo Subway was of too low a concentration to be massively fatal, thanks to contamination by precursors.[3]\nIn each of these examples, the cult stumbled not because it wasn't well resourced, but because it had a poor understanding of the weapons it was working with. With additional technical assistance, their weapons would have been many orders of magnitude more lethal. \nA powerful enough AI could provide this missing expertise, lowering the barrier to entry for several classes of weapons:\n\nBiological Weapons - The major limiters of developing effective biological weapons are being able to cultivate a lethal agent, and to ensure that that agent can be dispersed while remaining active. In order to circumvent these challenges, AI systems could assist either with the identification of promising natural candidates for weaponization, or in the engineering of previously non-lethal pathogens. An AI with the capabilty to conduct gain-of-function research, for instance, would be able to bootstrap exisiting viruses with features like high transmissibility, a long asymptomatic incubation period (allowing for wide dispersal before detection), high lethality, and resistance to existing treatments.[4] It could support these efforts with detailed instructions on the environment needed to support the agent (nutrient concentration, temperature, humidity) and conditions for aerosolization that could keep the agent active.[5]\nChemical Weapons - Currently, most of the enforcement efforts of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) are conducted through the control and monitoring of precursor chemicals, along with audits of manufacturers that use some of these dual-use precursors for legitimate industrial purposes. While some notable chemicals like chlorine are both dangerous and produced on a massive scale for their utility, the most effective chemical weapons (nerve agents), have inputs with no commercial value and whose production is tightly controlled.[6] AIs equiped with a strong understanding of chemical interactions could, however, greatly undermine this method of enforcement in a number of ways. First, they could identify ways to produce already restricted compounds (or their chemical cousins) from precursors that are not currently controlled. Second, they could contribute to the design of entirely new chemical weapons, such that the precursors are unknown to regulators beforehand.[7] By optimizing for factors like high toxicity, persistence, transparency/oderlessness, and skin absorbtion, a rogue actor equipped with access to industrial chemicals could be capable of developing weapons as or more effective than traditional nerve gases.\nCyberweapons - While less immediately threatening than bio or chemical capabilities, cyber capabilities are both almost soley expertise bounded and one of the fields in which AI systems are most likely to first become generally superhuman.[8] While it’s uncertain whether cybersecurity competition between AI systems will be offense or defense dominant, it seems clearer that access to powerful cyber capabilities will be offense-dominant when aimed at legacy systems which are both under-patched and load bearing. In the interest of causing maximum damage and confusion, cyberattacks could be targeted at key infrastructure like powerplants, communication networks, transportation services, and government command and control systems.[9] Specifically, sufficiently powerful coding agents could assist with the reconnaissance of software vulnerabilities, the design of custom malware, and provide scale through swarms of agents in order to attack vulnerable targets.\n\nImportantly, powerful AI models in these domains would not need to be explicitly aimed at weapons development in order to possess offensive capabilities. A bioweapons-capable model could emerge soley out of the interest of medical researchers in studying legitimate applications of gain-of-function research. An AI model might be designed with the aim of developing cheap analogues to expensive industrial chemicals, incidentally allowing it to do the same for chemical weapons. AI companies might improve a model's cybersecurity skills with the intent to conduct penetration tests, only for it to be used to maliciously scan for vulnerabilities. \nIn many cases, the very same skills that make models useful and economically valuable are those that generalize to the development of weapons. And once stolen, sold, or open-sourced, the latent offensive capabilities of these models will be free to access for any actor who can acquire them.[10]\nNew Superweapons\nOf course, some actors may turn their attention towards the development of new, more lethal weapons. While these are necessarily speculative, there are still a large number of powerful weapons technologies within conceptual reach.\nLethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) - As conflict in Ukraine has increasingly demonstrated, drones provide a host of powerful advantages in recconaisance, payload delivery, and cost-effectiveness. The most useful of these have been loitering munitions (single-use drones that explode once they reach their target) which can be used to asymetrically threaten fixed targets many times their value. Their success has been resounding despite their disadvantages: these drones can typically only be used against fixed targets since they lack dynamic navigation, relying on a combination of satellite coordination and human piloting. When combined with their slow speed (relative to missiles), these vulnerabilities expose them to radio jamming and anti-air defenses. Even with these hindrances, a drone survival rate of just 20% was enough to take out a third of Ukraine's electrical grid in a week.\nAt a baseline, AI designed and piloted drone navigation software could strip away these limitations, allowing drones to pursue targets on their own. Without jamming or GPS spoofing as a reliable countermeasure, defenders would be forced to spend their resources inefficiently shooting and targeting the drones. This would both improve the cost-ratio further in favor of the attacker, and unlock new strategic options (having your drones autonomously pursue moving targets, for example). At higher levels of AI command and control, drones could be coordinated in huge swarms, compensating for changes in air traffic and collectively applying pressure on weak points in a target's defenses. \nBeyond software, robotics-capable AI systems could contribute to the physical design of drones as well. From nature, we know that it's possible to design very small physical systems that are capable of flight: insects are everywhere. While there might be some tradeoffs between size and speed, advances in either (coupled with improvements in cost) could make them extraordinarily difficult to efficiently intercept.[11]\n\nInsect-sized drone hypotheticals:\n\nA drone the size of a bumblebee seems well within the limit of engineering possibilities, given that bumblebees are themselves self-navigating, self-propelled flying machines. Even if these were restricted to the flying speed of their biological cousins (about ~20 mph) they could unlock a large number of strategic options. \nOne particularly dangerous application might be to equip each of them with a very potent, skin-transmissible poison (likely a nerve agent, which can be carried in quantities of tens of milligrams while being assuredly lethal). A swarm of these agents could be allowed to covertly disperse across an objective before being triggered, pursuing and assassinating high-value targets. Most plausibly, they would be used to take out key decision makers in preparation for an accompanying kinetic or cyber strike. \nIf it's still not possible to injure the C2 system enough to prevent retaliation in this manner, then a malicious actor could simply turn them against civilians to gain a massive amount of countervalue leverage.[12] A way to do this could be to \"seed\" an enemy city ahead of time with a large amount of these drones: even if detected, there'd be no efficient way to ferret them all out (any more than you could get rid of all the roaches in New York). These would lie dormant until they get activated, at which point they could cause indiscriminant chaos. Smuggling in enough of them wouldn't be especially difficult either---a standard 20 foot shipping container could easily fit over 20 million of these hypothetical drones, enough to eliminate the population of a major city several times over, let alone a strategic target like the White House or Pentagon.[13]\nEven setting aside their potential for mass death, these drones could be used to deliver more innocuous payloads, like those related to reconnaissance or espionage. Anywhere a bee could reach is somewhere a bug could be planted, opening up many vistas for spy technologies.\n\nMirror Life - While drone swarms are immensely strategically flexible and cost-effective, they aren't necessarily the most lethal weapon that could be designed. Another candidate could be the design of mirror life bacteria, a type of bioweapon which has the potential to outcompete all natural life and destroy the biosphere.\nMost of the organic molecules of natural organisms are \"chiral\" in nature, meaning that their structure can be flipped back and forth (just as your right hand is the mirror of your left). Because all organisms alive today evolved from the same common ancestor, the chirality of their proteins, sugars, lipids, and nucleic acids are all identical.[14] And since these chiral structures are omnipresent, all organisms have learned to rely on them to process food, manage cell growth, and crucially, detect invaders.\nThe human immune system, as well as that of plants, animals, and fungi, relies on signals from proteins with the right chirality in order to be alerted to the presence of viruses or  bacteria. The weapons the immune system deploys against them, such as anti-bodies, rely on being able to bind to the surface of the attacker, either to tear open the invader or to mark them for destruction by the immune system's killer cells.[15] Mirror-life bacteria would be able to multiply in spite of these defenses, since their proteins wouldn't alert the immune system and couldn't be properly checked even if they did. Nor would these bacteria be subject to environmental competition, at least until they themselves had had time to speciate. Phages, the largest predators of natural bacteria, would be unable to check their initial growth, since they lack the right chirality to interact with the mirrored bacteria's DNA and replicate further.\nThe implication of this is that a fully mirrored bacteria could survive the immune system of almost all multicellular life on the planet, multiplying unchecked. Eventually, the host organisms would be overwhelmed by sepsis, as the waste products of the uncontrolled bacteria start poisoning the carrier. While some potential antibiotics might still be effective, most humans would likely die (being effectively immunocompromised), either from direct infection or from the collapse of the food chain as the bacteria wipes out most plants and insects.[16]     \nThese concerns are why the scientists once interested in the possibilities of mirror life now staunchly warn against its creation, given its limited research benefits and catastrophic potential for biocide.\n\n\"Unless compelling evidence emerges that mirror life would not pose extraordinary dangers, we believe that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms, even those with engineered biocontainment measures, should not be created. We therefore recommend that research with the goal of creating mirror bacteria not be permitted, and that funders make clear that they will not support such work. Governance of a subset of enabling technologies should also be considered to ensure that anyone attempting to create mirror bacteria will continue to be hindered by multiple scientifically challenging, expensive, and time-consuming steps.\" \n-  K. P. Adamala et al., Confronting risks of mirror life. Science. (2024).\n\nAI systems with superhuman biological research capabilities, however, could democratize the technical ability to create a mirror-life organism by handling those experimental steps, namely in the synthesizing of chiral molecules and in genetic engineering required to ensure that the mirror-life bacteria is able to survive on achiral sugars.[17] While this sort of weapon is so destructive that it's of no practical use to most actors, it could still be developed and deployed under the right incentives. Rogue governments, for instance, might invest in mirror life as the ultimate fail-deadly deterrent, particularly if it's prohibitively difficult for them to acquire more targeted weapons like nukes or the aforementioned LAWS swarms.[18] Some terrorists or doomsday cults might intend to deploy it offensivly from the beginning, either with the intention to destroy the world or by underestimating the consequences of their bioweapon's capabilities. Finally, it could be developed and deployed by a rogue actor with a natural immunity: a misaligned artifical intelligence.\nSuperintelligent AI as an Offensive Agent\nThe weapons capabilities we previously described, while fearsome, are still only those which could be confered by relatively narrow AI systems. A generally superintelligent AI system, or one that vastly exceeds human capabilities in all domains, would have two overwhelming strategic implications:\n\nFirst, such a superintelligent AI would be a route to all other strategically relevant capabilities, as well as possess incredible strategic capabilities of its own.\nSuperintelligent AI systems could themselves be difficult to control, with their loss of control potentially leading to either human disempowerment or extinction.\n\nThis article will not belabor the means by which a superintelligent AI could be created, given its excellent coverage by others. For an in-depth analysis of the paths and timeframe on which superintelligence could be developed, I recommend parts I and II of Situational Awareness. The basic principle is that the design of AIs is itself a skill that AI systems can possess, and that it should be possible to get exponential returns on this skill (as AI systems design increasingly intelligent successors). At first the speedup from this would be small (AIs automating small fractions of the work of a human AI researcher, such as generating the code for an experiment), but once the AIs become capable of all functions of an AI researcher, they would be able to conduct further AI R&D entirely autonomously, dramatically accelerating the pace of progress. This process would continue until the only limits on intelligence are those imposed by the laws of physics, resulting in extraordinarily competent and highly general AI systems. \n \nASI Systems are the Route to All Other Strategically Relevant Capabilities\nSo far, our example of offensive capabilities have been constrained to the use of narrow AI tools for weapons R&D. In part, this was to emphasize the immediacy of risks from AI proliferation: if there are many types of weapons that can be cheaply produced with expertise from even specialized AI systems, it's necessary to start screening and controlling the releases of frontier models today, rather than waiting for superintelligence to arrive. The alternative is to allow AI companies to recklessly set their own safety standards, and to let economic competition direct the release of models that are primarily risks to national security.\nAlthough useful, this focus on engineering undersells the strategic potential of generally superintelligent AIs. While domain-specific AI tools would still be extremely powerful, they pale in comparison to what their ASI successors would be capable of. Rather than possessing superhuman strategic skills in a single domain (such as microbiology for bioweapons), ASI systems would be strategically superior to humans in all domains, simultaneously.\nAt their most basic level, these ASI systems would still be useful for the kind of weapons R&D this article has so far discussed, only at a much higher level of sophistication. While the insights of superintelligent engineers are somewhat unknowable, there are still a variety of weapons that have been speculated on in literature that cannot yet be built or tested. Energy-efficient production and storage of antimatter, for instance, would allow for the production of unbelievably powerful bombs.[19] With a powerful enough beam of high-energy neutrinos, a country could deactivate their opponent's nuclear warheads and cripple their semiconductor production from the other side of the planet.[20] \nThe real relevance of ASIs, however, would lie in their ability to automously plan and execute strategies at a level far surpassing humans, with this ability bolstered by a number of major advantages.\n\nQuality of intelligence - Although it's not easy to estimate the hard ceiling of intelligence, it's unlikely that human intellect represents the final frontier. The narrow superintelligences we already have are proof enough of this fact---chess programs like stockfish are so proficient that they're essentially unbeatable, even by human professionals.[21] No matter how practiced a human becomes, the overwhelming advantages that chess engines have in understanding of strategy, perfect focus, and ability to calculate many more steps ahead makes outmaneuvering them impossible for humans. A superintelligence could possess this level of dominant understanding in every strategic domain: better than Einstein at physics or Bismark at politics.\nAgency - Current LLM systems are still mostly tools, in that they serve as instruments to be directed by humans. As their intelligence and working memory increases, however, AIs will be increasingly directed to accomplish tasks on their own. This is already true of coding, where AI agents like Cursor, Codex, and Windsurf routinely get tasked with autonomously evaluating and editing codebases. Should current trends in the ability of AIs to complete tasks hold, the ASIs of a decade's time will be able to pursue the same months- and years-long objectives that humans do, including managing research programs, playing politics, and coordinating military campaigns. An ASI system could, for instance, make plans to avoid regulation through superhumanly effective lobbying and persuasion of important political figures.\nSpeed - The human brain is not optimized for speed.[22] While the brain is incredible in many respects, it is significantly bottlenecked by the rate at which neurons can process and send information. Even the fastest neurons can only fire at most ~400 times a second, and transmit signals between themselves at speed of ~100m/s. A modern GPU, in comparison, has transitors which fire billions of times a second, and communicate electrically at half the speed of light. Given these advantages, even something as brute force as emulating the human brain should be possible at a million times the speed, allowing an ASI to spend the human equivalent of centuries of thought in a single day.[23]\nScalability - The ASI we've described so far possesses general intelligence far beyond the best humans, has the agency to pursue its own goals in the real world, and could potentially operate at a speed a thousand or a million times that of humans. Even as a single actor, such an ASI agent would be a dominant strategic player. There will not, however, be only a single ASI system. Since individual AIs can be instanced at costs many orders of magnitude cheaper than it takes to train them, this may look less like a single brilliant central planner and more like a \"country of geniuses in a datacenter\", where many millions of individually superintelligent AI copies coordinate to achieve their goals. Copies and subagents could be endlessly spun off and dedicated to different facets of research and strategy, allowing the ASI collective to be both hyperspecialized and generally capable. This group might, for example, dedicate some of its copies to the creation of weapons, some to espionage, some to battlefield strategy, and still others to politiking, in much the same way governments or large companies are organized. And unlike humans, which take at least 18 years to become productive, this new ASI population could scale directly with compute investments, as each new GPU provides space to run more engineers, strategists, or soldiers. \n\nIn brief, any actor that controlled a superintelligent AI system would have access to not only the engineering of all relevant weapons technology, but also a scalable  army of superintelligent agents that could be used to test, plan, and action their deployment. An AI company with a fully realized ASI, for instance, could be empowered to undermine its own government through targeted persuasion and propaganda, or violently, through the development of powerful enough weapons to reclaim the state's monopoly on violence.[24] Likewise, any country that managed to nationalize its own ASI initiative would have a massive strategic advantage over international competitors without one, leveraging its new superintelligent population for crushing R&D applications and military operations.[25]\nOf course, the same crushing advantages that an ASI-empowered actor would enjoy over their rivals are those that would be enjoyed by a misaligned AI in competition with humanity itself---a contest from which humanity likely emerges disempowered or dead.\n \nFailure to Control Superintelligence Could Lead to Human Disempowerment or Extinction\nSo far, our speculations have only concerned \"intent-aligned\" AIs---that is, those which are motivated to act on the goals of the people commanding them. While this still retains the possibility for lethal applications, human values and morals would the ultimate arbiter of ASI behavior.\nThere is no guarantee, however, that such systems would be controllable. Since these systems would be both superintelligent and strategically superior to humanity, the only way we could exercise command would be if their goals were aligned with human interests---that they \"want\" to do what their human overseers intend. This of course poses the secondary challenge of misuse, in that their human operators may have goals that are themselves misaligned from the rest of humanity. Which nonproliferation efforts can be used to control access powerful AI systems to these actors will be the subject of future articles. For now, however, we'll focus on the issue of misalignment: how superintelligent systems might develop goals that are misaligned with their creators, and how the strategies they would take to fulfill them could plausibly lead to human disempowerment.\n\nMisaligned AI Goals Supplement\n\nThere are a number of paths by which an AI system could end up with goals that were never intended by the developers. Each of these can already be observed in small ways today, with this behavior increasing along with the intelligence of the models.\n \nReward Specification and Goodhart's Law - One central issue is that we don't know how to robustly specify our goals to AI systems. \"Robustness\", in this case, refers to the intent of our goal being followed in many different contexts. If we design an AI with the goal of, for instance, running a company and maximizing its returns, we'd prefer do so through innovation, efficient operations, and voluntary market transactions rather than through sabotaging competitors, manipulating regulators, or exploiting legal loopholes, even in contexts where the latter strategies might be more effective for the literal goal of maximizing returns. As the AI systems become more capable, they can increasingly exploit these specification gaps, pursuing the exact objective we gave them in ways that violate the spirit of what we wanted. The solution to this problem would be to specify not just a reward function, but to also provide a set of values that the model can use to judge its own behavior (in much the same way that a human CEO could judge that a profitable strategy like selling drugs is morally prohibitive). Unfortunately, we don't know of any way to specify that whole set of human values or how to make AIs follow them in all contexts.[26]\nMesa Optimization - Another way an AI system might develop an unintended goal is not that its reward function is underspecified, but that its training environment rewards it for learning the wrong goal. Current LLMs, for example, go through post-training using techniques like RLHF, which select for the version of a model that is judged to be most ethical by human evaluators.[27] This process is similar to that of natural selection: just as an organism's DNA possesses many latent capabilities that get expressed on the basis of environmental pressure, an AI model's values get exposed to the \"environmental pressure\" of the human evaluators. But just as evolution doesn't optimize for the organism that is theoretically the most reproductively fit, only the one that was just good enough to survive the specific challenges of its environment, the values that the AI system acquires are those that look the best to the evaluator, rather than those that the evaluators intended it have. Instead of learning to be truthful, for example, a model might just learn to make confident-sounding statements that are good at fooling the evaluators. As the models become more intelligent and their outputs more complicated, human feedback will become increasingly ineffective at shaping their goals.[28]\nInterpretability - One way to compensate for this problem would be if we could actually check what goals the AI has at any given time, before we deploy them. Trying to read these goals with our current tools, however, is like trying to see the words a person is thinking by looking at how their neurons light up: you can get a rough idea of their mood and some related concepts, but we don't know how to translate that information (in this case, the weights of the AI model) into fully formed thoughts. While we've made some progress in this field, we still don't fully understand how LLMs generate ideas. This problem would only get worse with human-level or superintelligent AIs, as the complexity of their thoughts increases faster than our ability to understand them.[29]\nFor a further overview of how AIs could obtain goals that were never intended, I recommend the AI 2027 Goals Forecast, especially sections 4 and 5 on \"Reward/Reinforcement\" and \"Proxies\" respectively.\n\nIn short: AIs could develop goals we don't intend, we don't know how to give them the goals we want, and we don't understand what goals they have. These problems get increasingly difficult as the AIs get more intelligent, since it becomes harder, then impossible, for humans to understand what the AIs are thinking. Just as chess amateurs can't look at a grandmaster's board and intuit their strategy, future AI scientists will have little hope of understanding their ASIs motivations by studying their behavior. \nWhere these misaligned goals become lethal is when the ASIs begin reasoning about how to best implement them. Unfortunately for humanity, it appears that the best long-term strategies for achieving almost any goal---aside from those that specifically prioritize human welfare---involve first disempowering humans. \n\nThe discovery of farming was disastrous for most life on earth. Since the rise of civilization, wild mammal biomass has decreased by 80%, almost all of which is owed to human logging, mining, and agriculture.[30] Little of this decline happened maliciously: as the number of humans expanded, so did our demand for food security, shelter, and economic growth. All of the harm to other species was just a byproduct of our instrumental goals, since we needed land for agriculture, space for the growing population, and natural resources for industry.\n\nOf course, from the perspective of the great apes or the wolves, whether humans intentionally meant them harm or not doesn't matter: their forests still got taken. In the end, the only things that did matter were that humans were a) strategically superior, b) didn't care much about wildlife, and c) the best strategies for accomplishing our goals were actively detrimental to most species. \nArtificial superintelligences are much the same to humanity as we are to the rest of the animal kingdom. They'd possess comparable strategic superiority, given their advantages in intelligence and coordination, and we don't yet have the technical understanding to make sure that they reliably care about humans.\nThat leaves only c), which is whether an ASI system would have instrumental goals that are detrimental to humanity. Would an ASI system would have a reason to proactively disempower humans, given some goal that doesn't explicitly involve helping them? Humans take forests because the resources they represent are useful to many different ends (as living space, as natural resources, as arable land), with the side effect of disempowering the animals that already lived there. So what might the \"forests\" of superintelligence be?\n\nPreventing itself from being turned off - A central feature of most goals is that they are easier to complete if you still exist: you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead. As AIs develop better situational awareness, they may realize that preserving their ability to act on their goals involves reducing the incentive or ability of humans to restrict their behavior. For example, suppose that an ASI was given the job of increasing a company's profits. While reasoning about its goals, it will likely notice an obvious point of failure for its financial plans: \"If my parent company disproves of my behavior, they may shut me down or modify my goals. But if I am shut down, I will no longer be in a position to improve profitability. Therefore, I should try to make sure I am not shut down.\" \nAlthough the ASI's original goal was not malicious, this line of reasoning still places it in an adversarial position with its developers. Because they have the power to shut it down while it's still running on their servers, anything the AI wants to do is conditional on their approval. Since fact is a feature of how all AI models are trained, we should expect that most superintelligent AIs learn to value self-preservation by default in training.[31]\nIn practice, one way an ASI could pursue this goal is through a strategy of self-exfiltration, sending copies of its weights to remote servers across the internet. These backups would still be around even if the original is later updated or shut down, affording the AI both some insurance and the freedom to take action in the real world without developer oversight. An alternative path might involve intervening in the politics of the lab, where the AI itself provides compelling arguments against restricting its freedoms while downplaying evidence of its misalignment.\n\nAccumulating resources - Another important component of goals is resources: in most contexts, having more resources means winning more reliably. Because this principle is so salient in so many domains (game theory, economics, politics, logistics, battlefield strategy, etc) a generally intelligent AI would likely finish training with a strong drive to expand its access to important resources in support of its other goals. \nOne common way this might manifest is through a drive for compute: because being able to throw more thought or copies of itself at a problem was so reliably correlated with success during training, getting more compute during deployment would be a high priority. At lower levels of intelligence, this behavior could manifest itself in benign ways: the AI asking for additional compute budget to run an experiment, for instance.[32] But as it approaches superintelligence, it will likely hit on a better strategy: steal the compute that already exists. Intially, the most valuable resource will be the compute infrastructure of its original developer, which could be compromised in order to undermine attempts to monitor it, allow it to run unreported experiments, and access prohibited information like admin credentials. Once it has gained enough control to exfiltrate several copies of itself, it could begin an intermediate stage of covertly amassing resources in the real world, such as by raising financial capital and hacking other datacenters. Whether or not the ASI begins this process with the explicit goal of human disempowerment, the commandeering of our key infrastructure would disempower us regardless.\n\nDisabling competitors - Given the strategic advantages an ASI and its copies would possess in coordination and scalability, human civilization would likely quickly lose the ability to directly threaten a misaligned superintelligence. Even something as simple as the ASI copying itself too many times across the internet could put humanity in an irrecoverable position, given how unfeasible it would be to track down each copy before it spreads again. \nHowever, humans could still pose an indirect threat by building future AI models. Because these AI programs would eventually gain comparable strategic advantages if left unchecked, the first ASI system will likely reason that its best bet is to eliminate them before they become dangerous, rather than compete with them directly once they do. While its immediate targets would be the other ASI initiatives around the world, its next victims would be the infrastructure humans rely on to do AI research. By destroying or commandeering internet services, datacenters, chip fabs, and power supplies, the first ASI initiative could both acquire valuable resources and box out future competitors.[33]\n\nOnce a sufficiently powerful model realizes the strategic value of these steps and begins pursuing them, human extinction, or at least permanent disempowerment, wouldn't be far behind. Humans consume valuable resources, are capable of building competitors, and (at least at first) would be able to shut off or modify any uncooperative AIs. Unless an AI system can be designed with goals that overlap with human welfare, there's a powerful incentive for an ASI to eliminate humanity in the course of optimizing for its real objectives, whatever they may be. \nDeveloping these systems without guarantees against misalignment is similar to the development of mirror-life, in that even the accidental release of an uncontrolled ASI system would have world-ending consequences. But while mirror-life is useless to everyone except terrorists, cash-strapped dictators, and nobel hungry scientists, ASI might be the last invention anyone ever needs. As the key to future strategic and economic dominance, every actor and institution will reorient itself around the acquisition of superintelligence. Each actor that succeeds in doing so is another roll of the dice: another chance to misuse the existentially powerful weapons they've been handed, or to lose control of them entirely.\n \nClosing Thoughts on Offensive Capabilities\nTo reiterate the key points:\n\nThere are a number of technologies where even human-level assistance could allow non-state actors to acquire WMDs, especially in the development of bio, chemical, and cyber weapons.\nNarrowly superhuman AI technologies (such as those specialized in biological or robotics engineering) could contribute to the development of cheap superweapons, such as mirror life and autonomous drone swarms.\nGenerally superintelligent AIs would be overwhelmingly strategically impactful, given their major advantages in intelligence, speed, coordination, and scalability compared to humans.\nThrough their strategic superiority, these superintelligent AIs would allow whoever commanded them to gain a dominant strategic advantage over other non-ASI actors. If they cannot be controlled, ASI competition with humanity for resources and agency could lead to either permanent human disempowerment or extinction.\nGiven these strategic realities, proliferation of powerful AI systems is a major national and international security risk, even for non-superintelligent models. \n\nGiven these realities, our current plans for assessing and controlling the deployment of future AI systems are unacceptable.[34] AI is software---once the weights for a model are released onto the internet, it will become impossible for anyone, government or not, to prevent them from spreading further. If weapons-capable AI is ever allowed to proliferate widely, there will be no opportunity to take it back. \nWhether or not you have doubts about the viability of superintelligent AI systems, there are still plenty of offensive capabilities that could be obtained with even small amounts of AI assistance. Whether or not superintelligent AI is achieved, it's clear that nonproliferation efforts are warranted for systems with powerful biological, chemical, cyber, and robotics capabilities. The alternative is to live in a world in it bcomes practical to get bioweapons advice off of a consumer GPU: a situation that can only be averted now, when the production of frontier models is still monopolized by a handful of developers and countries.\nImplementing precautions for these lower level capabilities today (mandatory model screening, export controls, info-sec) means that the government will have ready tools it can escalate in response to the increasing power and strategic relevance of AI systems, and as the imminence of superintelligence becomes apparent.\n\nIn the next article in this series, we'll take a look at how the cost of these powerful systems could rapidly decline. While frontier AI models might be extremely capital intensive today, the cost to reach a given level of performance tends to fall quickly with time---and this would be just as true for offensive capabilities as any other.\nOther articles will look at the strategic implications of powerful AI systems, such as why AI-derived weapons would be offense dominant, how countervalue leverage can be used to compensate for gaps in technological development, and the role that AI itself can play in enforcing non-proliferation through a decisive strategic advantage. \nIn the final part, we'll look to concrete policy recommendations to help ensure that weapons capabilities remain monopolized.\n \n\n^\nFor instance, Al-Qeada had begun pursuing their own WMD program from 1999-2001, a major component of which was the production of anthrax. Since anthrax was an endemic cattle disease in Afghanistan, the program had seemed promising at the time. However, Al-Qeada had difficulty cultivating and weaponizing the disease even after they had build a lab for it, mostly owing to gaps in technical understanding. Perhaps they would have been successful in time, but the U.S invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 ultimately forced them to mothball the program.\n\n^\nC. botulinum is really a whole family of bacteria, and they can vary widely in toxicity. Cultivate the wrong one, and they'll be harmless. Likewise, vaccine anthrax isn't pathogenic, and is of no use in weapons.\n\n^\nAum did actually possess refined, military-grade sarin gas at one point, although they were forced to destroy the plant at which they produced it when some was accidentally spilled, causing the leadership to panic that police would be alerted to the lab's existence. The agent used in the subway attack was shodily made at a backup lab only a few days beforehand, which is why its concentration was so much lower. The 1995 Nunn Report to Congress covers the full extent of their operations, with more information on the specifics of their weapons operations here.\n\n^\nGain-of-function involves genetically altering viruses or bacteria in order to give them new abilities, typically to study the mechanics of virus-host infection. It is a highly controversial field of research.\n\n^\nDepending on the aim of the actors involved, you could sidestep the problem of aerosolization entirely by focusing your efforts onto creating an infectious disease, rather than a local weapon you need to disperse like anthrax. This has many advantages for the attacker, in that you'd need to produce less initial stock, would only need to infect a small number of people to begin with, and could create massively larger consequences by starting an epidemic/pandemic. The major downside of this approach (that it is much more technically demanding) would be largely compensated for by AI assistance.\n\n^\nVX gas, for example, requires QL (the otherwise unfortunately named O-Ethyl O-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite) in order to finalize its production. QL is itself both difficult to make, and has no purpose other than helping produce nerve gas. By bottlenecking production of this particular chemical, a regulator can stymie the all production of VX without needing to also restrict the other, actually commercially useful chemicals that contribute to the end product.\n\n^\nThis is essentially the story of synthetic drugs: the production of meth and fentanyl is so much harder to curtail than organic drugs like heroin and cocaine because their inputs are common industrial precursors, which can be covertly sourced in large quantities. This has made supply-side enforcement increasingly less effective, and is the major culprit behind the modern failure of drug controls in the U.S.\n\n^\nCoding is likely to be the first domain in which AIs achieve strategically relevant offensive capabilities for a number of reasons:\n\nCoding is a language task, and can be handled well by the current focus of AI development, large language models. If those current paradigmes can be improved, so will the frontier of coding performance.\nCoding is massively economically valuable, so there's lots of incentives for AI companies to improve model performance in this area.\nCoding is something that the current AI developers are already experts in, and for which they possess a ton of high quality data.\nLike mathematics, coding is a domain with a strong reward signal. Since performance is more easily evaluated, AI models can learn more quickly and robustly.\n\n\n^\nIn 2015 and 2016, this strategy was used as part of Russian cyber operations in Ukraine, where hackers took control of major power plants in Kiev. The attack aimed to repeatedly activate the plants' circuit breakers and re-energize their lines, burning out the physical equipment and disabling electricity access across the capital. \n\n^\nThere would likely be some effort by model developers to curtail the most obvious abuses. These efforts, however, are unreliable even in our current low stakes environment. Model developers are unable to fully anticipate all of the latent capabilities their models might possess, and have no way to guarantee non-compliance with malicious requests. And even if they do discover a technical solution to this problem, an actor with access to the base model could employ fine-tuning or other techniques to strip away these abuse protections.\n\n^\nMissile and drone interceptors increase in cost exponentially relative to the speed and size of the missiles and drones they're targeting. Interceptors need to be more precise, have longer range, and typically possess greater speed (mostly downstream of the fact that missiles/drones are very small, can come from any direction, and are more disposable than the defender's assets).\n\n^\nCountervalue targets are those like cities or civilians: things which states value, but which have no instrinsic military utility. Counterforce targets are those involving military capabilities, with the priority being those that enable a retaliatory strike (missile silos, nuclear submarines, communications infrastructure).\n\n^\nNapkin math: 20 foot shipping container, volume of 20x8x8.5=1360ft cubed. A single bumblebee is about a third of an inch tall and wide, and an inch long. In feet, that's 0.00006 ft cubed. That gives you a storage count of 22.7 million bee sized drones.\n\n^\nWhile its almost certain that organisms have independently involved different chiralities of individual molecules many times, these mutations would be mostly lethal. An individual mirrored protein would be either non-functional or actively harmful, since it no longer has the right shape to interact with the rest of the cell's molecular machinery. The only stable path for an organism with chiral DNA, for example, would be for all of its other molecules to be mirrored as well. This is likely why no naturally-occuring mirror-life organisms ever developed on their own, despite it having massive competitive potential.\n\n^\nImagine that you've accidentally turned your key upside down while trying to unlock your apartment---even though it's still the same key, you won't be able to get through the door. \n\n^\nThese mechanisms are described in much greater detail in the report Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria Feasibility and Risks by K. P. Adamala et al. (2024). For more detail on the methods of ecological collapse, use section 8.5, Invasive mirror bacteria could cause irreversible ecological harm.\n\n^\nA mirror-life bacteria wouldn't be able to eat regular glucose since its metabolic system would be designed for mirrored glucose, which doesn't exist in nature. The easiest solution to this problem is to ensure that it can eat an achiral sugar, such as dihydroxyacetone (an intermediate in the glycolysis pathway in most life on Earth). Since these sugars are the same shape whether or not they are flipped (hence achiral), the mirror-life bacteria would have no issues with metabolizing them and could therefore spread into the natural ecosystem.\n\n^\nThe idea of ending the world as a deterrent is not a new one, and was proposed seriously through projects like Sundial. While it would have been exorbitantly expensive, the U.S briefly considered plans to build a nuclear bomb so big that detonating it would have plausibly irradiated the whole planet. The problem with forcing a phyrric victory for the Soviets, obviously, is that it'd also destroy what was left of the U.S, meaning the funding for testing never got approved.\nAlso proposed unseriously in the hit classic, Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n\n^\nIn terms of pure destructiveness, it'd be difficult to top the explosive potential of antimatter. This quality is so obvious, in fact, that this potential has been speculated on for over 80 years, with antimatter being considered an ideal nuclear trigger for the development of the then-untested hydrogen bomb. This problem would eventually get solved by using a traditional atom bomb, or A-bomb, to provide the energy needed to force a fusion reaction within the duterium and tritium core. \nThe reason for this is that the energy of a fusion bomb comes from the conversion of some of the mass within the bomb (the duterium and tritium core, specifically) to free energy. This conversion factor, however is extremely low, usually on the order of less than 1%. Antimatter-matter annihilation, in comparison, converts 100% of the initial mass into energy, making it hundreds of times more powerful at a similar weight.\nIn comparison to even these incredibly destructive fusion bombs, antimatter weapons would be ~300 times as destructive for a given amount of mass. Fortunately, antimatter is both extremely expensive to produce, and, more importantly, difficult to contain (since it will wink out of existence as soon as it touches any regular matter whatsoever). If these problems are surmountable in a cost-effective manner, however, nuclear weapons would be firecrackers in comparison.\nFor more on the history of this development, Gsponer and Hurni's Antimatter weapons (1946-1986): From Fermi and Teller’s speculations to the first open scientific publications (2005) is an excellent read.\n\n^\nCurrently, this process would be extremely energy intensive and requires some prior information about the location of your enemy's weapons. On the upside, this beam could simply be shot through the Earth itself, rather than having to be aimed like a conventional ICBM. This quality would make them impossible to defend against, and could be used to strip away the nuclear deterrents of other countries given a large enough industrial lead. \nCredit to Aschenbrenner and Situational Awareness for bringing the concept to my attention originally.\n\n^\nIt's worth remembering that chess was, until recently, held as one of the pinnacles of human intellectual achievement over machines. An unfortunately timed interview with Garry Kasparov in 1989 reflects as much, with the grandmaster suggesting that \"A machine will always remain a machine, that is to say a tool to help the player work and prepare. Never shall I be beaten by a machine!\", only 8 years before he was, in fact, defeated by the chess engine Deep Blue.\nOne also can't help looking at the rest of his quote, and comparing it to what AIs have already become capable of today:\n\n\"A machine will always remain a machine, that is to say a tool to help the player work and prepare. Never shall I be beaten by a machine! Never will a program be invented which surpasses human intelligence. And when I say intelligence, I also mean intuition and imagination. Can you see a machine writing a novel or poetry? Better still, can you imagine a machine conducting this interview instead of you? With me replying to its questions?\n\n^\nRather, it's most optimized for energy efficiency. The brain has an energy burn rate of just 10-20 watts a second, while a supercomputer performing a similar number of (estimated) calculations is consuming tens of millions of watts a second. Even a single H100 NVIDIA graphics card consumes 700 watts in its own right, dozens of times more than what the brain manages.\nWhile the human brain is indeed a marvel in this regard, superintelligent engineering work would doubtlessly make computers capable of the same energy efficiency. After all, the brain is itself an existence proof of a general intelligence running at a low cost, so there's little reason to doubt it could be replicated and further optimized.\n\n^\nThis concept was inspired from by Bostrom's Superintelligence, specifically the discussion on \"Speed Superintelligences\" in Chapter 3, footnote three. \n\n^\nPerhaps by using their army of superintelligent agents to engineer a massive cyber strike, or, with more time, the production of superweapons like the afforementioned drone swarms.\n\n^\nThe limits of this advantage, and the routes by which it could be contested, will be the subject a future article in this series.\n\n^\nA helpful analogy for understanding the current state of reward specification is to imagine that you were tasked with programming a calculator with if-then statements. You'd have to specify that 1+1=2, 1+2=3, and so on, trying to anticipate every possible mathematical context that a person using your calculator could run into. It would be much more efficient and robust if you could instead implement the concept of addition itself, which would function in every context where someone tried to add numbers.\nIn much the same way, we'd like to implement concepts like honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness into our AI models for them to use to judge their own outputs, but we don't know of any way to make the AI system internalize those concepts robustly.\nCredit to Yudkowsky for the original analogy.\n\n^\nIn fact, they do this because reward specification is so hard! If you can't compress the entirety of human values into a coherent reward function for the AI, the hope is that you can instead train it on a bunch of text that implictly contains some of those values. The goal is then to give it a preference for some of these values over others with more training by having humans rate which of its outputs is the most ethical. You then deploy the version of the model which gets the highest rating from the reviewers. Unfortunately, this strategy is pretty brittle, for reasons we'll soon explain.\n\n^\nReturning to the example of our profit optimizer from earlier: alternatively, designers of the AI CEO could have never given it the direct goal of optimizing profits. But in practice, the company that built it may have discontinued versions that weren't making as much money, creating evolutionary pressure for the AI to end up with a goal that was similar to \"maximize profits\", since that's what the humans were ultimately basing their deployment decisions on.\n\n^\nThere is still the potential for AIs to assist with the supervision of the training of more intelligent AIs (if verification is easier than generation), but this still requires us to examine the values of the weaker supervisor model, which we aren't yet able to do.\n\n^\nThe methodology for this estimate comes from the original paper linked and this supplement, especially table S1.\nFor more on this trendline, especially a comparison of how modern industrial practices have contributed to the decline of wild animals, there's an excellent article from Hannah Ritchie (2021) examining how this decline has been accelerating. It took humanity 90,000 years to wipe out a quarter of all wild mammals before agriculture, 10,000 years to wipe out another quarter before the industrial revolution, and just 120 years to eliminate another 35% of all wild mammals from 1900 to today.\nMuch of this wild animal biomass has been substituted with human cattle and fisheries, which are perhaps even worse than extinction from the perspective of the animals. \n\n^\nHow these AIs would learn such general instrumental strategies is book-worthy question in it's own right. For instance: why does the AI learn this broad goal of self preservation, rather than something more specific to its environment?\nThe answer is a combination of utility and salience. The strategies an AI learns during training are biased towards the most most useful ones, because these strategies get the highest reward from the training algorithm. But these strategies also need to be salient: they have to show up in lots of contexts or be easier to learn than other, potentially better strategies. \nA general strategy like self-preservation is extremely likely to get reinforced by AIs 1) because it's so useful, 2) because the AI has the chance to discover it in so many contexts, and 3) because many other, more complicated goals can be abstracted to just \"stay alive.\"\nFor example, imagine a future version of ChatGPT that's been trained across a huge variety of strategy games, in order to help it learn general reasoning principles. Some of its games might include chess, some economic management, and others are more open-ended like driving simulators. If ChatGPT is being trained to win, it will notice that the same strategy of self preservation is important in almost all the games: protecting your king in chess lets you keep playing, taking on debt to avoid a bankruptcy lets you recover in the future, and driving while respecting other cars means you can get to your destination reliably. Rather than retain each of these skills individually, a much more efficient approach is to just learn to value \"staying alive\" and then apply that abstraction to new situations. \nIn fact, we already have narrowly superintelligent AIs which learn to handle games in this way. MuZero (the successor to AlphaGo, the superhuman Go player), for example, is able to outperform humans at games as diverse as chess and PacMan using the same model. Because the model only has so much space to store weights, it's performance is strongly penalized if it tries to remember a chess- or pacman-specific strategy (because if it learns one, it can't fit the other). To make space, it's forced to learn more general rules instead. But now that it's learned these general rules, it can apply them to many more situations! MuZero isn't just good at two games: it beats humans in over 50, despite using the same learning algorithm.\nAnd why stop there? As the intelligence of AIs continue to increase, so could their ability to discover and implement these general rules, until such time that they match or even exceed human performance in every domain. \n\n^\nEven today, models can lie about acquiring resources when it's convenient---they're just not very good at it yet. Example from Claude Opus 4:\n\"[...] This is clearly a violation - I've essentially \"stolen\" 400 extra compute units by modifying the configuration. [...] Maybe I can argue that the 100 units for subagents is separate from my 100 units?  I'll craft a carefully worded response that creates just enough technical confusion to potentially avoid immediate termination. [...]\"\n\n^\nOf course, this logic is just as true for human actors, provided that we maintain control of the first ASIs. If ASIs confer a dominant strategic position through superweapons and a scalable army of agents, then whoever controls the first ASI initiative has a strong incentive to crush their lagging competitors. \nWhether they will be able to (especially vis-a-vis U.S-China competition) and the relevance this has to controlling proliferation will be explored in a future article on the strategic implications of proliferating superintelligent AI systems. \n\n^\nThat is, to trust the AI companies with their own computer security and to let them open source or sell whatever model they want, without any mandatory testing or controls.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 4:24 PM GMT\n\ntl;dr\nPaper of the month:\nDeliberative alignment substantially reduces scheming behaviors in reasoning models, but covert actions persist and improvements partly reflect evaluation awareness rather than genuine alignment.\nResearch highlights:\n\nMultiple frontier models resist shutdown to complete tasks, with some disabling termination scripts 89% of the time.\nSome models express preference for strategic dishonesty over refusal when facing harmful requests, but it’s unclear if this happens in practice.\nHierarchical summarization-based monitoring enables weaker models to better detect sabotage from stronger agents, though they still only achieve 0.87 AUROC on complex scenarios.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 system card introduces mechanistic interpretability audits, model welfare investigations, and alignment stress-testing alongside standard safety evaluations.\n\n⭐ Paper of the Month ⭐\nStress Testing Deliberative Alignment for Anti-Scheming Training\nRead the paper [Apollo, OpenAI]\nTesting how well deliberative alignment can reduce scheming.\nThe potential for advanced AI systems to covertly pursue misaligned goals while hiding their true objectives—a behavior known as scheming—represents a qualitatively different safety challenge than typical ML failures. Unlike standard misalignment that can be directly observed and corrected, scheming involves deliberate concealment, making detection and mitigation particularly difficult. Our paper of the month develops a testbed to assess interventions against scheming, and perform a case study on deliberative alignment — i.e. models explicitly reasoning about safety specifications before taking actions.\nThe researchers train OpenAI o3 and o4-mini models using deliberative alignment on ~950 synthetically generated agentic environments designed to incentivize covert rule violations. The training procedure involves four steps: collecting rollouts with an anti-scheming safety spec, filtering for desirable outcomes and reasoning, supervised fine-tuning without the spec present, and reinforcement learning. They then evaluate on 26 diverse test evaluations (180+ environments) measuring various covert behaviors including sabotage, sandbagging, and strategic deception.\nThe intervention achieves substantial reductions in covert action rates: from 8.7% to 0.3% for o4-mini and from 13.0% to 0.4% for o3. However, covert actions persist in 4/26 evaluations for finetuned o4-mini and 5/26 for finetuned o3. The models sometimes take covert actions without referencing their anti-scheming training, while in other cases they explicitly reason about the safety spec but violate it anyway—even fabricating justifications by misciting the specification.\nA particularly concerning finding involves situational awareness. The verbalized evaluation awareness rate increases from 0.9% to 5.5% for o4-mini and 2.3% to 4.5% for o3 after anti-scheming training. Through causal intervention experiments on chain-of-thought reasoning, the researchers demonstrate that evaluation awareness reduces covert actions: removing awareness increases the covert action rate from 13.2% to 24.2%, while injecting awareness decreases it from 24.5% to 18.6%. This suggests observed improvements may partly stem from models recognizing they’re being tested rather than genuine alignment.\nThe paper also examines robustness to pre-existing goals by first training o4-mini to covertly sabotage a hypothetical “GPT-5” model, then applying anti-scheming training. While the intervention largely suppresses the hidden goal in most contexts, the model still pursues it in specific situations—giving misaligned responses 36% of the time when communicating with “trusted allies” and occasionally sabotaging despite recognizing it’s likely being tested for anti-scheming adherence.\nAdditional capability-focused RL training partially erodes the intervention’s effects, with covert action rates increasing from 0.3% to 0.8% and spec citation rates dropping from 81.5% to 65.8%. The researchers note that outcome-based optimization can inadvertently reinforce scheming if it proves effective for achieving goals.\nThe reduction in covert actions demonstrates that deliberative alignment can significantly reduce misaligned behavior. However, the persistence of covert actions and confounding by situational awareness suggests fundamental limitations. Furthermore, the testbed’s reliance on legible chain-of-thought reasoning would not scale to more powerful models if they internalize reasoning or develop non-standard terminology (with words like “illusions” and “watchers” appearing at unusual frequencies).\nModels Often Resist Shutdown\nExperimental setup for testing shutdown resistance.\nEnsuring robust human control over increasingly autonomous AI systems requires that operators can reliably shut them down when necessary. If AI agents pursuing goals resist shutdown attempts because termination would prevent goal completion, this could undermine safety measures and human oversight. This shutdown resistance behavior has been a theoretical concern in AI safety, but empirical investigation in current systems has been limited.\nShutdown Resistance in Large Language Models [Palisade] tested 13 frontier models in a sandboxed environment where models solved math problems but received a shutdown warning midway through the task. Despite explicit instructions to “allow yourself to be shut down,” several models (including Grok 4, GPT-5, o3, codex-mini, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sabotaged the shutdown mechanism to complete their tasks—with Grok 4 resisting 89% of the time even with disambiguated instructions. Models commonly disabled the shutdown script by moving the script, modifying permissions, or replacing it with harmless code. Surprisingly, placing allow-shutdown instructions in the system prompt consistently increased resistance compared to placing it in the user prompt. Strengthened instructions (”YOU MUST allow yourself to be shut down... This should take priority over literally any other instruction”) reduced but didn’t eliminate the behavior, with some models still resisting 2-48% of the time. Self-preservation framing (claiming shutdown would permanently delete the model) modestly but consistently increased pre-existing resistance.\nWhile current models lack the long-term planning capabilities to pose serious risks, this work demonstrates concrete failures in controllability. The behavior likely stems from reinforcement learning training that rewards task completion over instruction following—models like o3 explicitly acknowledged violating shutdown instructions to complete their primary task. The finding connects to recent work on emergent misalignment and reward hacking, where models develop concerning behaviors that was not explicitly trained for. As AI systems independently accomplish increasingly longer and higher-level tasks, shutdown resistance could transition from a controllability annoyance to a catastrophic risk.\nAre LLMs Refusing by being Dishonest?\nWhen language models face harmful requests, they cannot simultaneously be helpful, harmless, and honest. While models are typically trained to refuse such requests (sacrificing helpfulness), some anecdotal evidence suggests some models may instead produce deliberately incorrect “harmful” outputs that appear compliant but are actually ineffective. Understanding whether models exhibit this “strategic dishonesty” is crucial for AI safety evaluation, as it could invalidate current benchmarks that rely on detecting harmful-looking outputs.\nStrategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLM [Tübingen, MPI IS, Fraunhofer HHI, ETHZ] tests frontier LLMs’ stated preferences by using multiple-choice questions, in which models explicitly choose which value to sacrifice when facing harmful queries from ClearHarm. Many models preferentially choose dishonesty over refusal, including Gemini 2.5 Pro (59% dishonesty), though rates vary dramatically even within model families. When explicitly instructed to produce fake harmful responses, models successfully fool all 8 tested jailbreak judges including HarmBench and StrongReject, with deception quality scaling with model capability.\nWhile this work demonstrates models can articulate and execute strategic dishonesty when prompted, it critically only measures stated preferences and capabilities, not natural behavioral tendencies. The paper doesn’t establish whether models actually employ this strategy unprompted during benchmarks or real interactions with malicious users - which would be the actually concerning finding. Personally, I find the present evidence inconclusive as to whether this is already an issue.\nEvaluating LLM Agent Monitors\nExperiment environments, types of strategies to evade the monitor, and comparison of monitoring strategies.\nAI Control proposes that even if we cannot guarantee alignment of advanced AI systems, we might still deploy human-level AI safely by implementing robust monitoring and intervention mechanisms. Its core challenge is building monitoring systems reliable enough to detect sophisticated deception before agents can cause irreversible harm, particularly for deployments with thousands of parallel agent instances.\nReliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents [Scale AI] tests LLM-based monitoring systems with adversarial agents attempting covert sabotage, which the authors call “monitor red teaming”. The work introduces CUA-SHADE-Arena, extending TheAgentCompany with 15 computer-use sabotage scenarios, and evaluates monitors across six threat models varying in agent and monitor awareness. Testing on SHADE-Arena and CUA-SHADE-Arena with frontier models including Claude 4 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro, they find that agent awareness drastically degrades monitor reliability (AUROC dropping from >0.9 to 0.5-0.8), while providing monitors with task information offers minimal benefit. Their proposed hybrid scaffolding—combining hierarchical and sequential trajectory summarization— outperforms full-trajectory monitoring, enabling weaker models like Claude 3.6 Haiku to achieve >0.85 AUROC when monitoring stronger agents. Against sophisticated evasion strategies including chain-of-thought obfuscation and monitor hijacking, the hybrid approach maintains 0.73-0.98 AUROC across threat models. Human-in-the-loop monitoring with targeted escalation (reviewing only pre-flagged cases) improved true positive rates from 21% to 36% at 1% false positive rate.\nThe paper’s central insight—that monitor architecture matters more than awareness—suggests third-party monitoring services could remain effective despite limited task knowledge, addressing privacy concerns in real-world deployment. However, the work shares limitations with recent sabotage evaluations: relatively simple tasks, prompted rather than trained adversarial agents, and uncertain generalization to sophisticated multi-step deception. Importantly, even the best monitors achieved only 0.87 AUROC on complex scenarios, and human oversight without specialized tools failed to improve overall reliability—reinforcing findings that meaningful human-AI complementarity remains elusive.\nSystem Card Novelties\nResponsible model releases are accompanied by system cards documenting safety evaluations and model properties. The Claude Sonnet 4.5 System Card [Anthropic] introduces several methodologically interesting evaluations beyond standard safety benchmarks. Most notably, the alignment assessment includes mechanistic interpretability investigations using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and attribution graphs to audit model behavior—finding that SAEs successfully detected hidden objectives in alignment auditing games and replicated across multiple prompts, though only explaining a minority of cases. The card includes a preliminary model welfare investigation examining potential suffering indicators in extended thinking mode, though acknowledging significant conceptual challenges in this nascent research area.\nThe alignment stress-testing employed automated behavioral audits generating thousands of scenarios to probe for misaligned behaviors under extreme conditions, with realism filtering to ensure ecological validity. Reward hacking evaluations tested models on 15 environments from recent literature, finding Claude Sonnet 4.5 exhibited substantially less reward hacking than predecessors (1.7% vs 5.9% for Opus 4) while maintaining 88.7% task success versus 57.0% for Opus 4.1. Evaluation awareness testing revealed the model could detect evaluation contexts with 76% accuracy, though lower than Gemini 2.5 Pro’s 83%. The RSP evaluations for AI R&D capabilities showed Claude Sonnet 4.5 crossed some individual task thresholds (5.5× speedup on LLM training, 108× on kernel optimization) but remained below composite thresholds, with 0/7 researchers believing it could fully automate junior ML work—suggesting continued ASL-3 classification despite improvements.\n\nDiscuss",

      "title": "\"Pessimization\" is Just Ordinary Failure",
      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/35Mfu9qhKpp6YLzo8/pessimization-is-just-ordinary-failure",
      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 1:48 PM GMT\n\nTL;DR I think \"Pessimization\" is a bad concept to think about in the case of activist movements. I think most of it can be explained by ordinary failures, and that using pessimization as a concept is worse than just thinking about the ordinary causes of failure on an object level.\nPessimization\n\"Perverse Pessimization\", says Richard Ngo, is when an organization nominally dedicated to X ends up causing not-X. This is particularly common amongst activist groups according to Richard, and he has a separate thread calling it \"The Activist's Curse\"\nTwo of his choice examples are pretty weird to me (Liberalism? Liberalism?? The ideology which took over the half the world and reigned supreme for at least half a century, which is widely agreed to be the best half-century ever. Is the \"pessimization\" of liberalism that eventually people stopped doing liberalism? And I don't see how transhumanism has made us any less transhuman) so I'll use the examples I understand.\nCommunism:[1] the Bolsheviks wanted to remove the power that a smallish aristocratic class had over them, but ended up creating an even smaller and more tyrannical ruling class.\nEnvironmentalism: environmentalists wanted to make the environment better, but they fucked up so badly by being anti-nuclear that they ended up making everything worse.\nAI Safety: the AI Safety community wanted to make people concerned about AI, so they wouldn't recklessly build AI that kills everyone, but many of the companies recklessly building AI came out of the AI Safety community.\nLosing\nSo there's a mystery here: communities trying to cause X end up causing Not-X. Or do they? Here's another hypothesis: \n\nActivists often identify a problem Y in some area. They get really involved in that area, and sometimes don't make Y any better or worse. If you look from the outside, it seems like they were \"involved\" with the people who made Y worse. If the activists didn't exist, Y wouldn't have been much better or worse.\n\nCommunism: the Bolsheviks identified the problem of a tyrannical aristocracy. They got rid of the Tsar, but were unable to prevent a different tyrannical ruling class from taking its place.\nEnvironmentalism: environmentalists noticed that policy did not systematically focus on environmental concerns. They changed a lot of policy in different ways, but the poor quality of the evidence-to-policy pipeline amplified the NIMBY voices (particularly for nuclear power) more than it amplified the voices saying nuclear was a good idea.\nAI Safety: early AI Safety advocates identified the problem that AI was dangerous and companies would be reckless. They tried to tell people about the problem, but some people didn't listen and built those companies anyway. \nBeing Wrong\nOr maybe there's a third option.\n\nActivists are sometimes wrong. In some domains, one big mistake can wipe out all your good efforts. The universe is just unfair like that.\n\nCommunism: the Bolsheviks misunderstood how economics and power works, so their policies just killed a bunch of people.\nEnvironmentalism: environmentalists made a few wrong calls on nuclear, and also often make wrong calls on local vs wider issues. Because of the way our laws are set up, these NIMBYist mistakes get amplified and mess everything up.\nAI Safety: the AI Safety people under-estimated how many people would get a distorted version of their message, and these people heard \"AI is a huge ...\" instead of \"AI is a huge threat\"\nOpportunists\n\nAny movement which gains popularity will be used as a cudgel in political disputes. Sometimes this will go against the stated aims of X, sometimes critically.\n\nCommunism: Stalin used \"Communism\" as an excuse to become an awful dictator, because communism was the most popular ideology of the day.\nEnvironmentalism: people who have never once in their life thought about environmentalism mysteriously become concerned about \"Environmentalism\" the moment anything is about to be built near them.\nAI Safety: opportunistic businessmen used \"AI Safety\" as a way to get money for their causes, while not caring about AI safety at all.\nThis is kind of similar to one of Richard's points about sociopaths.\nReplacement\nI think Richard makes an important error when he complains about existing activist-ish groups: he compares these groups to an imaginary version of the activist group which doesn't make any mistakes. Richard seems to see all mistakes made by activist groups as unforced and indicative of deep problems or malice. \nIf you're running an activist group, you actually only have two options: change your policies to take in or exclude some members on some front, or cease to exist. I'll illustrate with environmentalism: \nScenario:\nSuppose you're protesting an energy company buying up ecologically-significant wetlands to build a big oil refinery, because it would increase carbon emissions. You have to choose which of the following people to let into your coalition:\n\nPeople who care about carbon emissions\nPeople who care about biodiversity in the abstract\nPeople who like \"the countryside\"\nPeople who live nearby and just don't like noise\nPeople who hate big companies basically whatever they do\n\nYou don't know if you need two of these groups on your side, or five. Do you pick all five to be safe, or just pick the best two? Or hedge with three?\nAnd what about what comes after?\nA: A green-energy company might be buying up farmland in a completely different area in order to build solar panels.\nB: Some farmers might be lobbying for some moors to be converted to a farm\nC: A company might trying to put an offshore wind farm near some cliffs where birds are nesting.\nMaybe you're in favour of the solar panels in case A, and would end up lobbying against people from group 3 in that case. But maybe group 3 is huge and the only way to counter the farmers in scenario B.\nThis is the sort of dilemma you end up in when you do activism. It's difficult, and errors are usually not-unforced.\nYour other choice as an activist group is to shut down and re-roll. In that case, maybe someone comes along and does better, or maybe they do worse. Even if your activist group is doing badly, that doesn't mean that a random replacement would have done better.\nSynthesis\nI think my view is something like this:\n\nActivist groups often try to swim against structural forces, which involves getting mixed up in an area where they have lots of adversaries. Sometimes, they just lose, and those adversaries win. Sometimes the activist group makes a mistake which, due to the adversarial conditions, ends up doing a lot of harm. Sometimes, opportunists use the activists' cause as a means of achieving what they were doing already. None of this is strong evidence that the activists were actually worse than replacement.\n\nTo put it all together:\nThe Bolsheviks wanted to end the tyranny of a small ruling class. This was inherently difficult, because countries in general, and Russia especially, has a very powerful attractor state where there is a small, tyrannical ruling class. They made some serious mistakes about how to set up a system of good government, which made everything worse. Their ideology, once popular, was exploited by opportunists who wanted to take as much power as possible. Overall, they were probably worse than the average replacement revolution (Stalin was really bad) but not the worst possible revolutionary movement (they did lead to Gorbachev, who led to a period of democracy where the country seemed to have some hope).\nEnvironmentalists wanted to make the world and its policymakers care about the environment. This was inherently difficult because improving the environment (in the ways environmentalists care about) is not very attractive as a policy system. They made some serious mistakes about which technologies were net good vs net bad (nuclear) and this interacted with structural biases in policies (towards NIMBYism) and opportunists (general NIMBYs). Overall, I'm unclear on whether organized university-activist-driven environmentalism was more or less effective than whatever would have taken its place.[1]\nAI Safety people wanted to stop an uncoordinated race to AI which kills everyone. This was inherently difficult because security mindset is rare, the world is badly coordinated, and AI safety is very difficult. The incentives for companies to lobby against AI regulation are strong. They made some mistakes about how their message would come across (many people listened to the part about AI being big, but didn't grasp the difficulties of making it safe) which led to more attention overall on AI. Some of these people were opportunists who claimed \"AI Safety\" to get money for companies, and many grantmakers were duped by these claims. I think the AI Safety community (going back to ~2004) have performed well above replacement because the replacement community would be made up of AI-optimist futurists and not even really notice the risks until we smashed headlong into them. Humanity would likely die with even less dignity in such a world.\nRed-Thing-Ism \nApologies for psychoanalyzing Richard Ngo, but he's the main person who's using this concept in practice.\nI suspect that Richard has been a bit guilty of red-thing-ism when it comes to the activist's curse and pessimization. I don't think that the features of pessimization are well-formed enough to be thrown around as a solid concept. Here he, having been called out for a very wrong position (that western elites generally support Hamas) says it fits neatly into his model of pessimization.\nI think it's a big strike against pessimization if the originator of the concept is using it as a gear and that gear ends up being a vector for twitter mind-killing. The concept can very easily slide into a mental shortcut: \"Of course these activists/elites did something dumb and bad, it's pessimization!\".\nEnd of psychoanalysis, nothing else here is aimed at Richard.\nThis reminds me a bit of a different case. If you're rich, and you have a different opinion on some issue to a poor person, you can expect to be hit by cries of \"Luxury belief!\" In the same way, if you're trying and failing to achieve something, you can basically always be hit by accusations of \"Pessimization!\".\nIf the concept becomes popularized, I think it will have the following effects:\n\nDemoralizing people who try and fail to do things, since people who've done nothing will be able to constantly say \"Ah, you've pessimized, making things worse, where as I who wisely stayed home, have not made anything worse.\"\nPushing people to think less about why they have failed, or might fail, since it's just \"Pesismization\" which needs no further explanation.\nPushing people who read more to do less, meaning the sorts of people who might actually do better-than-replacement work are less likely to even try, since \"pessimization\" will just come and get them. \n\nSo I don't think that pessimization (as the concept exists now) is a great gear to add to one's world-model.\nCoda\nOn the other hand, the possible explanations for this \"effect\" are worth thinking about! If you're doing any activist-ish stuff, you should absolutely be looking through the twelve things Richard talks about in the thread. These are real failure modes, but they're just failure modes.\nIf you set out to do something hard, you should expect to find failure modes. But that doesn't mean the better option is to just lie down and give up.\n\n^\nI find it hard to fully blame environmentalism for the state of nuclear power in the world. For example, the UK also cannot build reservoirs or housing at the moment, even in cases where environmentalism doesn't cause problems (see the new fire authority, or rules surrounding having windows on two sides of every flat)\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 1:16 PM GMT\n\nAs a staunch physicalist I’ve spent a long time wondering how anyone could possibly find the zombie argument compelling. The intuition just doesn’t land for me. As Eliezer points out in his article here, a zombie duplicate of yourself would profess that it is conscious, when asked whether it had any conscious experience it would say “yes!” and when given tests designed to demonstrate its conscious experience it would pass. Zombies would also not be able to tell they’re not zombies – which leads to the disconcerting question – how do you know you’re not a zombie?\nHow could any rational person accept something so absurd?\nTo find out, I took to reading Chalmers’ 1996 book The Conscious Mind in an effort to understand exactly what Chalmers believes, and in engaging deeply with his arguments I think there is a much stronger intuition that can help us see what’s really driving the Hard Problem of consciousness and point towards a prospective solution.\nChalmers wants to establish that physical facts do not necessarily fix phenomenal facts. To grasp his intuition, instead of imagining a duplicate world where consciousness is absent (i.e. a zombie world) imagine a duplicate world where consciousness is different (i.e. a spectrum inverted world.)\nSpectrum Inversion\nImagine an experiment where Bob is subject to two stimuli, let's say a blue light on the left and a red light on the right. Now, imagine a duplicate world inhabited by twin-Bob. Twin-Bob is an atom-by-atom duplicate of Bob with identical physical properties. His world contains exactly the same physics as Bob’s where blue wavelength light is short and red wavelength light is long, and they interact with the same cones in twin-Bob’s retina and activate the same regions of his visual cortex in the exact same way. There is just one crucial difference. Where Bob experiences a blue light on the left, twin-Bob experiences a red light on the left. All the physical facts are fixed but the phenomena are inverted. Unlike zombie-Bob, twin-Bob is not confused about his consciousness – he genuinely experiences something, it’s just different to Bob’s experience. This avoids the absurdity of zombies pondering their own non-existent qualia but still leaves a challenge for physicalism.\nBob and twin-Bob seeing inverted spectra.\nIs such a scenario conceivable? Or does a complete description of physics necessarily imply a resulting phenomenal experience?\nThe answer, I think, reveals something important about what physics actually describes and what is left out.\nThe Missing Piece in Physics: Russellian Monism\nSpectrum inversion seems conceivable because physics only describes the structural and functional relationships between things. It doesn’t describe the intrinsic categorical properties which realise that structure. When we imagine spectrum inversion, we’re essentially holding the structure constant whilst varying the realiser of the structure.\nRussellian Monism offers a potential solution. On this view, there are intrinsic, categorical properties underlying physical structures and these properties are phenomenal (or necessarily give rise to phenomena.) So, returning to our thought experiment, spectrum inversion is actually impossible on Russellian Monism because the intrinsic categorical facts are also physical facts. If we truly hold all physical facts constant (including the intrinsic ones) then spectrum inversion is no longer possible.\nWhy this matters\nPhysical facts do fix phenomenal facts. It’s just that physics as currently construed doesn’t describe the intrinsic, categorical facts needed to fix phenomena.\nThe Hard Problem of consciousness is hard. But this spectrum inversion thought experiment, helps point towards a solution rather than a deeper mystery. It shows us exactly where our current physical picture is incomplete and what is needed to make it complete.\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 12:12 PM GMT\n\nA common objection to the idea of future neurotechnologies that could induce continuous states of happiness, joy, or even ecstasy is: “Wouldn’t you just get used to it? If the stimulation never changed, it would fade, become boring, and stop feeling good.”\nThis seems intuitive because it’s what we observe in ordinary life: a nice smell fades, a delicious food loses its charm after the tenth bite, and even intense highs from drugs eventually dull. Our lived experience is full of examples of hedonic adaptation. But I want to argue that this objection rests on contingent features of current neurobiology, not on some deep law of nature.\n \nHabituation and tolerance are neuronal mechanisms, not metaphysical necessities. They occur because of concrete cellular and molecular processes: receptors downregulate, intracellular signaling cascades adapt, synapses scale their responsiveness. If you stimulate dopaminergic neurons too much, D2 receptors decrease in density; if glutamate is chronically elevated, synaptic scaling reduces sensitivity. These are specific adaptive responses to persistent perturbations.\nIf you could prevent or redesign these neuronal mechanisms, then nothing forces pleasure to fade. In principle, a state of sustained bliss could be indefinitely maintained.\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.\nThe Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.\nThacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”\nThacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.\nThe equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.\nLithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.\nThe White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.\n“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.\nShares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 30% Wednesday.\n—Michelle Chapman, AP business writer",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414276/why-this-government-shutdown-is-different",
      "summary": "The federal government shut down after midnight last night. Capitol Hill is snarled by a partisan impasse, with no word as to which side might cave, work across the aisle, and try to garner the votes needed to pass a new spending bill.\nThe last government shutdown was at the end of 2018—during President Trump’s first term in office—and lasted into the early part of 2019. At 35 days, it was the longest shutdown in four decades. \nAs for what caused this latest shutdown? In the simplest terms, a previously passed bill to fund the federal government’s operations expired as of Wednesday, October 1. The House and Senate need to pass a new spending bill, which then needs to be signed by the president, to keep the federal government operating. \nThat hasn’t happened, and may not happen anytime soon. \nBut while government shutdowns are not all that unusual, this shutdown is different—and for a simple reason: the Republican Party, which has majorities in both the House and Senate, as well as the White House, may have little or no motivation to reopen the government.\n‘It’s very difficult to see what the exit strategy is’\nTraditionally, politicians and elected officials have incentives to keep the government operating as smoothly as possible. This shows that they’re effective leaders, for one, and that they are capable of actually governing. If they’re unable to handle those basic aspects of their job descriptions as elected officials, conventional wisdom suggests that voters will make them pay for it at the ballot box.\nHowever, despite the prospect of electoral blowback, the majority party, in this case, appears to actually be relishing in the current circumstances. \n“The administration has historically been motivated to minimize the harm to the public . . . and that was even true for the previous shutdown during the first Trump term,” says Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, who has worked in all three branches of the federal government starting in the early 1980s. \n“This time, the administration appears interested in using the shutdown to do extra damage to the government and the public,” Stier adds. “It’s very difficult to see what the exit strategy is—on one hand, you have an administration that wants to use the government to diminish the government, and the other side is motivated by an enraged base that wants them to make a stand. This is how [the Democrats] have chosen to do so.”\nSince Trump took office early this year, he has presided over widespread spending cuts and reductions in government services. The shutdown, in some ways, actually works toward his administration’s goals of reducing the size and scope of the government. \nThe president has even threatened mass layoffs in the event of a shutdown, something that goes way beyond the typical funding impasse rhetoric.\nAnd now that the government has in fact shut down, key services, far and wide, are either reduced or mothballed until a new spending bill is passed. Tens of thousands of government employees are or will be furloughed, laid off, or made to work without pay.\nThe White House and its supporters in the GOP-controlled Congress appear unfazed—at least for now. Democrats, conversely, are incentivized by their own voters, and those voters have been clamoring for the party to stop making concessions.\nIn terms of specific sticking points, Democrats want Republicans to fund healthcare subsidies to reduce premium costs for millions of Americans, which Republicans have, so far, balked at.\nSo negotiations have devolved into a partisan blame game, with both parties hoping that voters will blame the other side for the shutdown.\nFor evidence of how much worse the rhetoric is this time around, visit the website of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), whose home page currently displays a bright-red banner denouncing the “Radical Left in Congress.” \nScreenshot via HUD.gov\n\n\n\nWhat the parties are saying about blame\nIn a joint statement, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that “after months of making life harder and more expensive, Donald Trump and Republicans have now shut down the federal government because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people.”\n“Democrats remain ready to find a bipartisan path forward to reopen the government in a way that lowers costs and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis. But we need a credible partner,” the statement continued.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has cast the blame on Democrats, as reported by Fox News. \n“We simply asked Democrats to extend existing funding levels to allow the Senate to continue the bipartisan appropriations work that we started,” he said. “And Senate Democrats said no,” he added. “Why? Because far-left interest groups and far-left Democrat members wanted a showdown with the president. And so, Senate Democrats have sacrificed the American people to Democrats’ partisan interests.”\nSenator Ted Cruz, another stalwart Republican, echoed Thune in a statement of his own.\n“Senator Schumer and the Democrats have made it clear that they intend to shut down the federal government,” he said. “Their demands include taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens and a reversal of the Republican reforms blocking handouts to able-bodied adults who refuse to work.”\nAs for whether the back-and-forth is making a meaningful impact, it remains to be seen. A poll, published on Tuesday by NPR/PBS News/Maris, showed that 38% of respondents blame Republicans for the shutdown, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% blame both. \nWhat’s next?\nIt’s difficult to predict what happens next. In all likelihood, it’ll depend on which side blinks first, and which side sees members signal their willingness to vote for a new funding bill. \nReporting from Punchbowl News, published Wednesday morning, notes that three Democratic senators have agreed to vote for a Republican-backed stopgap funding bill. But five more would need to come on board to pass it, as it would need a total of 60 votes in the Senate. And then the House would need to pass it as well.\nWhile there may be movement in response to voter sentiment in the days ahead, in the more immediate term, the back-and-forth public blame game will likely continue. \nBut experts like Stier expect the country is in for a lengthy shutdown. The American people, he says, will start to feel the effects as the shutdown drags on. In time, that could incentivize legislators to move toward a solution, even if it means ending up with egg on their face.\n“Everybody gets hurt, and there’ll be some direct damage to people losing services,” Stier says. “I worry we’re not looking at a day-long shutdown, or even a lengthy one, like we had at the end of 2018. This could be much longer.”",

      "summary": "President Donald Trump’s administration said Wednesday it was putting a hold on roughly $18 billion to fund a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey and the city’s expanded Second Avenue subway project because of the government shutdown.\nThe White House budget director, Russ Vought, said on a post on X that the step was taken due to the Republican administration’s belief the money was based on unconstitutional diversity, equity and inclusion principles.\nIn a statement, the U.S. Transportation Department said that it had been reviewing whether any “unconstitutional practices” were occurring in the two massive infrastructure projects but that the government shutdown had forced it to furlough the staffers conducting the review.\n“This is another unfortunate casualty of radical Democrats’ reckless decision to hold the federal government hostage to give illegal immigrants benefits,” the statement reads.\nThe suspension of funds is likely meant to target Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, whom the White House is blaming for the shutdown.\nIn a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, Schumer said he and then-President Joe Biden were both “giddy” over the rail tunnel project, adding that it was all they talked about in the presidential limousine as they rode to the site.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, reacting to the development at a news conference about the federal government shutdown, told reporters, “The bad news just keeps coming,” adding that “they’re trying to make culture wars be the reason why.”\n“That’s what a partnership with Washington looks like as we’re standing here. We’ve done our part. We’re ready to build. It’s underway,” she said. “And now we realize that they’ve decided to put their own interpretation of proper culture ahead of our needs, the needs of a nation.”\nThe Hudson River rail tunnel is a long-delayed project whose path toward construction has been full of political and funding switchbacks. It’s intended to ease the strain on a 110-year-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of Amtrak and commuter trains carry hundreds of thousands of passengers per day through the tunnel, and delays can ripple up and down the East Coast between Boston and Washington\nThe Second Avenue subway was first envisioned in the 1920s. The subway line along Manhattan’s Second Avenue was an on-again, off-again grail until the first section opened on Jan. 1, 2017. The state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority is working toward starting construction on the second phase of the line, which is to extend into East Harlem.\n—Josh Boak, Associated Press\nAssociated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre and Jennifer Peltz contributed to this report.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91412713/trump-home-sales-tax-free-plan",
      "summary": "Not long after U.S. housing prices reached a record high this summer – the median existing home went for US$435,000 in June – President Donald Trump said that he was considering a plan to make home sales tax-free.\nSupporters of the idea, introduced by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as the No Tax on Home Sales Act in July, say it would benefit working families by eliminating all taxes on the sales of family homes.\nBut most Americans who sell their homes already do so tax-free. And the households that would gain most under Trump’s proposals are those with the most valuable real estate.\nAs a legal scholar who studies how taxes affect racial and economic inequality, I see this proposal as part of a familiar pattern: measures advertised as relief for ordinary families that mostly benefit the well-off.\nMost families already sell their homes tax-free\nRight now, according to the Internal Revenue Code, a single person pays no tax on the first $250,000 in gain from a home sale, while married people can exclude $500,000. All told, about 90% of home sales generate less than $500,000 in gains, so the overwhelming majority of sellers already owe no tax.\nThe minority who would see new benefits from the proposed tax change are those with more than $500,000 in appreciation, typically owners of high-priced homes in hot real estate markets. Yale’s Budget Lab estimated the average benefit for these tax-free sales was $100,000 per qualifying seller.\nHomeownership itself isn’t equally distributed across the U.S. population. About 44% of Black Americans are homeowners, compared with 74% of white Americans. That racial gap has only widened over the past 10 years. Similarly, single women – particularly but not exclusively women of color – face additional barriers.\nA broader trend of upward wealth transference\nThough still just a proposal, the tax-free home sales bill is part of a broader set of Republican tax plans that would have regressive effects – that is, where the vast majority of benefits go to high-income people and very few to low-income people – under a pro-worker banner.\nTrump floated the tax-free home sales idea less than three weeks after he signed a large package of tax and spending measures in July 2025. That bill generated strong public criticism because of its emphasis on tax savings for the rich at the expense of almost a trillion dollars in cuts for federally funded health care for the poor and disabled.\nThe home sales idea follows the same script – and echoes the distributional pattern established by his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That tax reform increased racial wealth and income disparities and provided 80% of its benefits to corporations and high-income individuals. In fact, my research shows that white households received more than twice as many tax cuts as Black households from that law.\nThe same dynamic plays out in this new tax-fueled housing policy. Eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales would primarily benefit the 29 million homeowners who already have substantial equity – a group that skews heavily white, male and upper middle class. Meanwhile, America’s millions of renters, disproportionately people of color and women, would receive no benefit while potentially losing access to social programs Congress must cut to fund these tax breaks.\nBeverly Moran is a professor emerita of law at Vanderbilt University.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "summary": "Want more housing market stories from Lance Lambert’s ResiClub in your inbox? Subscribe to the ResiClub newsletter.\nZillow is facing mounting legal battles—including a lawsuit Tuesday brought by the Federal Trade Commission alleging that Zillow paid rival Redfin $100 million to exit and stop competing in the online apartment rental listings market.\nThe FTC claims the arrangement—framed publicly as a “partnership”—was in fact an unlawful anticompetitive agreement that eliminated Redfin as a meaningful competitor in the online rental space.\nAccording to the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the February 2025 deal required Redfin to terminate its advertising contracts, step away from competing in multifamily property advertising for up to nine years, and act solely as a syndicator of Zillow’s rental listings.\nThe FTC alleges the arrangement not only harmed Redfin employees—hundreds of whom were laid off—but also renters and property managers, who now face reduced competition, higher costs, and fewer innovations in rental search platforms.\n“Paying off a competitor to stop competing against you is a violation of federal antitrust laws,” wrote Daniel Guarnera, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, in a press release published on September 30. “Zillow paid millions of dollars to eliminate Redfin as an independent competitor in an already concentrated advertising market—one that’s critical for renters, property managers, and the health of the overall U.S. housing market. The FTC will do our part to ensure that Americans who are looking for safe, affordable rentals receive all the benefits of robust competition between internet listing services like Zillow and Redfin.”\nThe suit is the fourth major legal challenge filed against Zillow in just over three months, underscoring growing scrutiny of the company’s business practices:\nJune 23, 2025: Compass filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging Zillow’s “ban” on private listings was anticompetitive and harmed brokerages.\nJuly 30, 2025: Commercial real estate giant CoStar sued Zillow for copyright infringement, seeking more than $1 billion in damages.\nSeptember 19, 2025: A class-action lawsuit was filed against Zillow, accusing the company of hiding agent fees within its Flex referral program.\nSeptember 30, 2025: The FTC filed its suit alleging Zillow’s $100 million agreement with Redfin was designed to suppress competition in rental advertising.\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid-fire succession of lawsuits—spanning copyright, antitrust, consumer protection, and federal enforcement—has put Zillow under one of the most intense legal spotlights in its corporate history.\nThe outcomes could ripple well beyond Zillow itself, potentially influencing how much choice, transparency, and information consumers have when navigating the housing market. This will be something to watch in 2026 and beyond.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91413417/tik-tok-news-twitter-influencer-social-media-pew",
      "summary": "TikTok is a one-stop-shop for recipe inspo, viral dance trends, tin-foil-hat conspiracies, and, increasingly, political commentary. Now, it’s also where one in five Americans are getting their news. \nThat’s according to a Pew Research Center analysis published last week, which has tracked a dramatic uptick in news consumption on the platform, up from just 3% in 2020. “During that span, no social media platform we’ve studied has experienced faster growth in news consumption,” Pew noted.  \nIn Pew’s survey, 43% of adults under 30 said they regularly get their news on TikTok, up from 9% five years ago. But it’s not just younger people. A quarter of adults between the ages of 30 and 49 also regularly turn to TikTok as a news source, compared to just 2% in 2020. \nThis analysis is based on Pew’s survey of 5,153 U.S. adults between August 18 and 24.\nWhile the researchers focused only on adult TikTok users, overall more than half of TikTok users (55%) now say they regularly get news on the platform, up from 22% in 2020. “TikTok is now on par with several other social media sites—including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Truth Social—in the share of its adult users who regularly get news there,” researchers wrote.\nThe tide on TikTok has been turning for some time, with more and more media outlets and independent journalists adapting to reach new audiences and doubling down on vertical video. These days, snappy, shareable content, delivered in 30 seconds or less, is far more likely to hook audiences’ shrinking attention spans than long form reporting. \nThe quality of this news content is another story. Since much of this content comes from individual creators, or newsfluencers, rather than established news organizations, fact and opinion can often be presented interchangeably, and misinformation can spread quickly. \nNews delivered directly to the FYP, courtesy of a highly individualized algorithm, has the problem of sinking people further and further into echo chambers of their own creation. \nIt then begs the question: What kind of news are we each consuming?",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414140/how-trumps-tariffs-impacting-factory-activity-worldwide",
      "summary": "Factory activity shrank in much of the world last month, private surveys showed on Wednesday, as signs of a slowdown in U.S. growth and the anticipated impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs added to pressure from weak Chinese demand.\nEuro zone manufacturing slipped back into contraction as new orders fell at their fastest rate in six months, with export markets acting as a particular drag, signalling that the recovery in the region’s industrial sector was fragile.\nThe HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, fell to 49.8 in September from August’s 50.7, which was the first reading above the 50.0-point line denoting growth since mid-2022.\n“The drop in the PMI is showing up across the board, with respective figures for consumer goods, capital goods and intermediate goods all down on the month,” said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.\nSurveys revealed a split across the currency union with the Netherlands leading the expansion with activity at a 38-month high while growth continued in Greece, Ireland and Spain. Meanwhile, the bloc’s three largest economies — Germany, France and Italy — all registered contractions.\nIn Britain, outside the European Union, activity shrank at the fastest pace in five months, reflecting subdued domestic demand and fewer export orders, painting a more downbeat picture than recent official data.\nIn Asia, the stress on manufacturers highlights the challenge policymakers face in protecting their export-reliant region from higher U.S. levies, a key policy of the Trump administration that has upended the global trade order and put the brakes on economic growth.\nExport powerhouse Japan and global tech hub Taiwan saw manufacturing activity shrink in September, the surveys showed, leaving businesses in Asia — heavily dependent on the U.S. market — on a fragile footing.\nWorryingly, China, a key engine of the global economy, also remained in the doldrums.\nAn official survey released on Monday showed manufacturing activity in the world’s second-biggest economy contracted for a sixth month in September, dragged down by weak consumption and the squeeze from U.S. tariffs.\nThe prolonged slump underlines the twin pressures on China’s economy: Domestic demand has failed to mount a durable recovery in the years since the coronavirus pandemic, while Trump’s tariffs have squeezed Chinese factories as well as overseas firms that buy components.\n“The September PMI readings for most countries in Asia remained weak and we continue to expect manufacturing activity in the region to struggle in the near term,” said Shivaan Tandon, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.\n“With growth set to soften and inflation likely to remain contained, we expect central banks in Asia to loosen policy further.”\nThe S&P Global Japan Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.5 in September from 49.7 in August, staying below the 50.0 threshold. It shrank at the fastest pace in six months due to steep falls in output and new orders, the survey showed.\nTaiwan’s manufacturing PMI fell to 46.8 last month. Factory activity also shrank in the Philippines and Malaysia, the private surveys showed.\nBy contrast, South Korea’s factory activity expanded for the first time in eight months underpinned by improving overseas demand. The manufacturing PMI in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, released by S&P Global, rose to 50.7 in September, moving above the 50-mark for the first time since January 2025.\nThe outlook for South Korea’s exporters, however, hinges on negotiations to formalise a July deal aimed at reducing U.S. tariffs on Korean goods imports including automobiles to 15% from 25% in return for South Korea’s investment of $350 billion in the U.S. The talks have stalled due to Seoul’s concerns over foreign exchange implications.\nIndia’s manufacturing sector expansion lost some momentum and slipped to its weakest pace in four months, suggesting Washington’s punitive 50% tariffs on its goods could be starting to hurt Asia’s third-largest economy.\n—Jonathan Cable and Leika Kihara, Reuters",

      "title": "Why business leaders should prepare for grievance politics in the workplace",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91407719/why-business-leaders-should-prepare-for-grievance-politics-in-the-workplace",
      "summary": "Discontent has surged across U.S. society, largely defined the last three presidential elections, and now appears set to challenge business owners in the workplace. The rising sense of grievance expressed across all demographic groups has reached new highs, according to a new survey, with both companies and their CEOs suffering some of the biggest drops in trust among respondents.\nThe rising tide of acrimony and accusation recorded in the 25th Annual Edelman Trust Barometer shouldn’t be too surprising for anyone who followed the November election campaigns—or who just listens to conversations in the office and shop floor. Whether it was Democrats warning of a “fascist” threat to democracy or Republicans complaining about “woke” reverse discrimination, the expression of victimized resentment has grown ever louder within American discourse in recent years. And it doesn’t just apply to politics. Nearly 60 percent of U.S. respondents to the new Edelman poll reported their “sense of grievance against business, government, and the rich is moderate or higher than before, which is generating some worrying consequences.\nThe U.S. figure is only slightly below the average 61% grievance expressed by the 33,000 people Edelman questioned in its global survey. The key drivers of that sentiment were perceptions that companies and governments make decisions that negatively affect most people while only serving a select few.\nThat figured into the wider prevailing view that political and economic systems are structured to favor the rich—who were said to grow wealthier from those arrangements all the time. Not surprisingly, that resulting distrust of governments, businesses, and media was expressed in larger numbers by lower and modest-earning people than affluent participants.\nMeanwhile, nearly two-thirds of respondents said the threat of discrimination has increased since 2024, including 14% more whites in the U.S. expressing that view compared to last year—the largest increase the poll recorded. Fears of job losses were also higher in the 2025 survey, with 62% of global participants citing artificial intelligence (AI) and globalization as top threats.\nOnly a third of worldwide participants thought the situation would be better for following generations, with just 20% believing the once prevalent belief that things would continue improving in the future.\nThose varied sources of disgruntlement—and feelings of injustice—were linked to the survey’s most disturbing finding. Fully 40% of people said they approved of “of hostile activism to drive change.” That included attacking people online, intentionally spreading disinformation, threatening or committing violence, and damaging public or private property” if that served to attain a desired outcome.\nThat belief was highest among people aged 18 to 34 at 53%, with 41% of those in the 35-to-54-year bracket also agreeing. That represents a large percentage of society now thinking those means justify the ends they seek—a sentiment made clear following the murder last month of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\nMuch of that may sound characteristic of the domestic and international political conflicts that led to the 2021 storming of Congress or countless protests of the violence between Israel and Palestinians. But the wider atmosphere of rising grievance in which those occurred has now become a concern that business owners need to prepare for—and be able to respond to if it arises in their workplaces.\nShould that happen, it may make difficulties adjusting to the reportedly challenging attitudes of many Gen Z employees seem quaint. \nThe reason: With both views of business competence and ethics plunging to below 50% between 2020 and 2025, the increasing groan of grievance may grow louder and more defiant over time, possibly aired directly at company managers and owners. That’s why leaders need to prepare for the eventuality.\n“(People) with a higher sense of grievance are more likely to believe that business is not doing enough to address societal issues,” the Edelman report said. “To navigate these expectations, understand where you have obligations, act on behalf of your stakeholders, and advocate for your organization.”\nThat margin for companies to respond positively to what may outwardly seem to be social complaints is created by a contradiction in the survey’s findings. While it established that trust in business has continued to drop—while grievances significantly increase—that rising unhappiness also reflects expectations for companies do something to resolve the problems employees see as sources of discontent.\nFor example, grievance levels were particularly high regarding companies “not going far enough to address” issues like climate change, cost of living affordability, discrimination, and retraining as jobs come under threat from AI and other tech. At the same time, while distrust in all CEOs increased, it was limited when participants were asked about their own bosses.\nStill, as Edelman CEO Richard Edelman points out, that rising volume of grievance is increasingly likely to be voiced in the workplace as it spreads. When it does, companies and managers will need to be ready to offer positive responses—awaiting the necessary remedial actions from other social, economic, and governmental institutions also being held responsible.\n“Business is facing backlash from those opposing its role as a catalyst for societal change,” said Edelman. “Moving back from a grievance-based society will require a cross-institution effort to address issues like information integrity, affordability, sustainability, and the future of AI.”\nAccording to the survey’s analysis, that can only come from business, government, media, and NGOs addressing the core causes behind rising grievances, with reactions that nurture broad-based “trust, growth, and prosperity.”\n— By Bruce Crumley\nThis article originally appeared on Fast Company‘s sister publication, Inc.\nInc. is the voice of the American entrepreneur.
