      "summary": "After a few years of mostly humming along in the background, Amazon's game streaming service is receiving a bit of an update. Amazon Luna will still act as a game streaming service with a rotating library of free games for Prime users, but now, Amazon also plans to offer \"GameNight,\" a collection of social party games that you can play with your friends with just a smartphone. The expansion is about more than just new games: Amazon's Prime Gaming brand is now also part of Luna.\nAmazon says the new GameNight collection includes over 25 multiplayer games, some that are reinterpretations of classic games like Angry Birds, Exploding Kittens or Ticket to Ride, and others that are entirely original and developed by Amazon, like Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg. If you've played any of Jackbox's various multiplayer games, GameNight seems to use a similar setup. You load up the game in Luna, whoever's playing scans an onscreen QR code with their phone and then they can join the game using their device as a controller.\n\n\nThe hope is that these smartphone-controlled games will lower the barrier to entry for anyone intimidated by a controller, or who hasn't already taken advantage of Luna as part of their Prime subscription. For everyone else, though, Amazon says the service is getting a collection of new high-profile games in the near future, including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and Dave the Diver. As before, if you're willing to pay for one of Amazon's add-on subscriptions you can add even more games to your library, too. Unlike GameNight games, though, all of these titles will require a controller to play, whether it's Amazon's Luna Controller or a Bluetooth controller connected to the Luna app.\nAs far as Prime Gaming is concerned, Amazon's not retiring the benefits of the plan, but rather using them to bolster Luna. Prime Gaming launched as Twitch Prime, a program that unlocked unique emotes, one free Twitch sub and free PC games every month if you linked your Twitch and Amazon accounts. Those benefits will still be available after Prime Gaming is retired, and Twitch says that any free PC games you redeem will be available \"wherever Amazon Prime is available as part of Luna Standard.\" That includes regions where you can't stream Luna yet.\nWhile confusing, adding more games and folding Prime Gaming into Luna suggests that Amazon views the service as the gaming project it's prioritizing moving forward. It doesn't have the library of Xbox Cloud Gaming and it's not clear if Amazon is as gun-ho about streaming as Microsoft is, but if the company is willing to pay, offering more games and more ways to play them seems like a good move.\nUpdate, October 1 2025, 6:07PM ET: The story and its headline have been updated to include details about Amazon's changes to Prime Gaming.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazon-luna-will-offer-controller-free-party-games-in-an-attempt-to-woo-prime-subscribers-130004416.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Forbes has published an investigation into Amazon's efforts to court law enforcement clients for artificial intelligence and surveillance services. The article reveals that not only is the company promoting Amazon Web Services as a potential police tool, but it has been partnering with other businesses in that sector to use its cloud infrastructure. According to the Forbes report, Amazon's partners that are pitching police departments include car tracking tools and license plate readers from Flock Safety, gun detection by ZeroEyes, real-time crime center apps from C3 AI and Revir Technologies, and AI that helps compose police reports from Abel Police and Mark43. The piece estimated that the police tech business is worth $11 billion. Based on emails sent by members of Amazon's law enforcement and safety team, the company is working awfully hard to get a share of those billions.\nThe company's aggressive sales work has raised outcry for privacy issues around how police officers might use these tools, which is unsurprising given that AI tools can create inaccuracies and easily be misused. Regulation is still a piecemeal affair and some law enforcement departments have failed to follow what laws do exist about tech use.\n\n\"​​It's dismaying to see one of the largest and most powerful companies pushing authoritarian surveillance tech in this way,\" ACLU Senior Policy Analyst Jay Stanley told Forbes. \"I didn't realize Amazon was serving as a midwife for AI law enforcement technologies.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-is-reportedly-aggressively-pitching-law-enforcement-on-its-cloud-services-215334082.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Ubisoft has launched — and named — its Tencent-backed subsidiary. Vantage Studios is the first of the company's \"creative houses\" under a previously-announced reorganization. The new studio will oversee the company's tentpole franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.\nThe news follows Ubisoft's March announcement of a new subsidiary with a €1.16 billion ($1.36 billion) investment from Tencent. The Chinese company took a minority ownership stake in Vantage as part of the deal. In July, Ubisoft named the new subsidiary's co-CEOs: Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot.\n\n\"Our focus is on evolving Ubisoft's operating model to bring more focus, more autonomy and more accountability to the teams so they can stay closely attuned to our players,\" Guillemot said at the time. \"Decision making will be quicker, and it will also be easier to pivot when we need to change course.\"\n\nUbisoft\n\nUbisoft's announcement today reflected that language. The idea is to give its developers \"a higher level of autonomy\" at Vantage and future studios. It wants the new structure to enable \"a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback.\"\nVantage is the only creative house the parent company has announced. The company will set up future ones \"under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise.\" However, it's unclear what other creative houses will work on, with Vantage taking over Ubisoft's bread-and-butter franchises.\nVantage's team will be spread across Ubisoft's offices in Montréal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona and Sofia. Multiple gaming publications, including GamesIndustry.biz, reported that the studio began operations today. Ubisoft is said to have chosen \"Vantage Studios\" based on a vote by its 2,300 employees. As for Tencent, it will reportedly act in an advisory role, with the co-CEOs having the final word.\nUbisoft was due for some big changes. The company has endured big-name flops, studio closures and layoffs. At least Assassin's Creed: Shadows has done well.\nIncidentally, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six titles were among those added to Game Pass on Wednesday. Microsoft seems to have intended for the announcement to soften the blow of the service's 50 percent price hike. I'm not so sure it worked.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-launches-its-new-tencent-backed-subsidiary-194750403.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "It's not officially called October Prime Day, and it doesn't technically start until next Tuesday, but Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days 2025 sale is already offering up quite a few deals on kitchen tech. And we're finding a good number of deals on the air fryers, multicookers, soda makers and more that we've tested and recommend. The Engadget team has tested plenty of excellent kitchen tech, as seen in our reviews and buying guides. so if you want to read up before you buy, you can. We'll be adding more deals to this list as we get closer to Tuesday, and expect to add a lot more once the sale officially starts. For now, here are the best Prime Day kitchen deals we could find. \n \nThe best October Prime Day kitchen deals \n \n \n \nNinja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. \n  \nInstant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time.\n \nInstant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen.\n \nBreville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks.\n \nCosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket.\n \nInstant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black.\n \nInstant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function.\n \nBreville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists.\n \nBreville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-early-october-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-39-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-193009170.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "If raising console prices wasn't enough to scare you away, Microsoft has also increased the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by 50 percent. That makes the subscription cost $30 per month when it used to be $20. Even if it comes with more games and the benefits of a Fortnite Crew subscription, you wouldn't be wrong for wanting to cancel. \nCancelling means you'll also lose ability to play online multiplayer games, but cheaper tiers of Game Pass received new benefits without getting a similar price hike, so downgrading might be worth considering. Whichever you choose, the process of managing your subscription is relatively easy, provided you remember your login information.\n\nHow to cancel your Game Pass subscription\n\nIan Carlos Campbell for Engadget\n\nRather than managing your Game Pass subscription on your Xbox, you'll need to log in to your Microsoft account through a web browser. To get started:\nAccess your account by clicking the profile icon in the top-right corner of Microsoft's website, or by heading to account.microsoft.com and logging in.\n\n\nClick on the Subscriptions tab in the left sidebar.\n\n\nIn the Game Pass section, click on Manage.\n\n\nThen click on Cancel subscription, the last option in the menu.\n\n\nDepending on when you subscribed and when your next billing date is, Microsoft might offer to refund a portion of your subscription if you choose to unsubscribe immediately, rather than wait to the end of your billing period. Whichever you choose, once you confirm, you'll be unsubscribed.\nHow to downgrade to a cheaper Game Pass subscription\n\nIan Carlos Campbell for Engadget\n\nIf you'd prefer to just switch to a more affordable subscription, like Game Pass Premium for $15 per month or Game Pass Essential for $10 per month, the process is nearly the same.\nLog in to your account through Microsoft's website or account.microsoft.com.\n\n\nClick on the Subscriptions tab in the left sidebar.\n\n\nIn the Game Pass section, click on Manage.\n\n\nThen, click on Change subscription plan.\n\n\nConsider your options, then click on Switch subscription to change plans.\n\n\nMicrosoft will ask you to confirm your decision and potentially choose a payment option, but once you click on Subscribe, you'll be all set.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/how-to-cancel-or-downgrade-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription-191801458.html?src=rss",

      "title": "The best VPN deals: Get up to 87 percent off ProtonVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and more",
      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-vpn-deals-120056041.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) can come in handy daily, whether you're using one to streaming foreign TV shows or trying to save money buy browsing international sites for discounts. But if you're going to invest in a VPN, it's worth checking for sales and deals first before you subscribe. Pricing can be tricky for these services — and far from transparent — but there are deals to be had.\nVPN provides often provide deep discounts to those willing to sign up for one- or two-year plans, paying the full charge for the period upfront. This is a win-win — they boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.\n\nBest VPN deals\n\nNordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping.\nExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock.\nExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark Starter+ — $59.13 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): If you want some of the extra features of the Surfshark suite but aren't interested in jumping all the way to Surfshark One, try this intermediate tier instead. Starter+ includes Alternative ID, which you can use to mask your details when you sign up for online accounts, and Surfshark Search, a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking. This is another year-round deal that works out to an 86 percent discount.\nSurfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (86 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This evergreen deal gives you 86 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nhide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with two months free (73 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. However, if you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nLike I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-vpn-deals-120056041.html?src=rss",

      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "Wireless headphones have come a long way from the bulky designs of the past. Today’s models are lighter, smarter and packed with features that make them useful for everything from travel to long workdays at your desk. Many offer strong noise cancellation, quick pairing and reliable battery life — all of which makes them an easy upgrade if you want more freedom from your devices.\nOf course, not every listener has the same needs. Some people want portability, which is why our guide to the best earbuds is worth a look, while others want something more specialized like the best gaming headsets or the best budget earbuds. But if you’re after over-ear headphones that focus on comfort and immersive sound, this roundup of the best wireless headphones highlights the top choices we’ve tested.\n \nTable of contents\n \n \n \nBest wireless headphones for 2025\n \n \nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\n \n \nHow we test over-ear headphones\n \n \nOther wireless headphones we tested\n \n \nWireless headphones FAQs\n \n \nBest wireless headphones for 2025\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\n \nWhen it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.\n  \nThe next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and Bluetooth multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.\n \nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.\n \nHow we test over-ear headphones\n \nThe primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\n \nTo judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\n \nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.\n \nOther wireless headphones we tested\n \nAirPods Max\n \nApple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\n \nDyson On-Trac\n \nThe On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.\n \nSonos Ace\n \nThe Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\n \nSony ULT Wear\n \nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\n \nSony WH-CH720N\n \nWhile the WH-CH720N are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.\n \nBeats Studio Pro\n \nThe Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\n \nBose QuietComfort Ultra headphones\n \nBose’s latest flagship model has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.\n \nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\n \nThe MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\n \nBowers & Wilkins Px8\n \nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.\n \nWireless headphones FAQs\n \nHow can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?\n \nI typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality. \n \nHow do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?\n \n“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?\n \nWhich brand has the best wireless headphones?\n \nSony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.\n \nDo expensive wireless headphones sound better?\n \nExorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins’ headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technica’s M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",

He replaced the lidar sensors when they broke—which was all too often, and seemingly at random—and developed complex calibration methods and maintenance routines just to keep them functioning and the cars drivable.\nSo, when he reached the end of his rope, he invented a more robust technology—what he calls the “most powerful micromachine ever made.”\nAguilar and his team at startup Omnitron Sensors developed new micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology that he claims can produce more force per unit area than any other. By supplying new levels of power to micromirrors, the technology is capable of precisely steering lidar’s laser beams, even while weathering hazardous elements and the bumps and bangs of the open road. With chips under test by auto-industry customers, Omnitron is now modifying the technology to reduce the power consumed by AI data centers.\nLidar, a scanning and detection system that uses lasers to determine how far away objects are, is often adopted by self-driving cars to find obstacles and navigate. Even as the market for lidar is expected to grow by 13.6 percent annually, lidar use in the automotive industry has remained relatively stagnant in recent years, Aguilar says, in part because the technology’s lifespan is so short. \nVibration from bumpy roads and severe environmental conditions are the biggest reliability killers for automotive lidar, says Mo Li, who studies photonic systems at the University of Washington. The optical alignment within the lidar package atop self-driving cars is delicate—tremors from a poor paving job could physically alter where the mirrors sit in the housing, potentially misaligning the beam and causing the system to fail. Or temperature fluctuations could cause parts to expand or contract with the same unfortunate outcome, he explains.\nAguilar wondered which part broke most often and found the culprit to be scanners, the parts responsible for angling small mirrors that direct the laser beam out of the system’s housing. He wanted to make scanners that could withstand the tough conditions lidar faces, and silicon flexures stood out as a solution. These structures act like springs and allow for meticulous control of the mirrors within lidar systems without wearing out, as the standard metal springs do, Aguilar claims.\nDesigning a better chip\nAguilar hoped the new material would be the answer to the problem that plagued him, but even silicon springs didn’t make lidar systems as robust as they needed to be to withstand the elements they faced.\nTo make lidar even stronger, the team at Omnitron aimed to design a more powerful MEMS chip by increasing the amount of force the device can apply to control the mirrors in the lidar array. And they claim to have achieved it—their chip can exert 10 times more force per unit area on an actuator that positions a micromirror or other sensor component than the current industry standard, they say. That extra force allows for extremely valuable control in fine adjustment. \nTo reach this achievement, they had to dig deep—literally. \n  Omnitron’s micromirrors steer lidar beams and could find use in data centers.Omnitron\nIn this MEMS device, the mirror and its actuator are etched into a single silicon wafer. On its non-mirror end, the actuator is covered with tiny, closely spaced plates that fit between trenches in the wafer, like the interlocking teeth of two combs. To move the mirror, voltage is applied, and electrostatic forces angle the mirror into a specific position by moving the plates up and down within the trenches as the electric field pulls across the trench sidewalls. \nThe force that can be used to move the mirror is limited by the ratio of depth to width of the trenches, called aspect ratio. Put simply, the deeper the trenches are, the more electrostatic force can be applied to an actuator, which  leads to a higher range of motion for the sensor. But fabricating deep, narrow trenches is a difficult endeavor. Overcoming this limiting factor was a must for Aguilar. \nAguilar says Omnitron was able to improve on the around 20:1 aspect ratio he notes is typical for MEMS (other experts say 30:1 or 40:1 is closer to average these days) , reaching up to 100:1 through experimentation and prototyping in small university foundries across the United States “That’s really our core breakthrough,” Aguilar says. “It was through blood, sweat, tears, and frustration that we started this company.”\nThe startup has secured over $800 million in letters of intent from automotive partners, Aguilar says, and is two months into an 18 month plan to prove that it can produce its chips at full demand rate. \nEven after verifying production capabilities, the technology will have to face “very tough” safety testing for thousands of consecutive hours in realistic conditions, like vibrations, thermal cycles, and rain, before it can come to market, Li says.\nSaving power\nIn the meantime, Omnitron is applying its technology to solve a different problem faced by a different industry. By 2030, AI data centers are expected to require around 945 terawatt hours to function—more than the country of Japan consumes today. The problem is “the way data moves,” Aguilar says. When data is sent from one part of the data center to another, optical signals are converted into electrical signals, rerouted, and then turned back to optical signals to be sent on their way. This process, which takes place in systems called network switches, burns huge amounts of power.\nGoogle’s solution, called Apollo, is to keep the data packets in the form of optical signals for the duration of their travels, which yields a 40 percent power savings, the company claims. Apollo does so by using an array of mirrors to direct the data. Aguilar is planning to make the process even more efficient using dense arrays of Omnitron’s more powerful mirrors. Doing so could quadruple the amount of data each network switch could route by increasing the number of channels in each switch from 126 to 441, Aguilar says.\nOmnitron is still early in its data center implementation, so it’s not yet clear to what degree this technology can really improve on Google’s Apollo. However, following a “critical design review” in mid-September, “one of the world’s top AI hyperscalers has requested our mirrors for their next generation switch,” Aguilar says. “This is proof that Omnitron solves a problem that even the biggest AI infrastructure companies can’t address in house.”\nAnd there may be even more applications to come. Omnitron has received feelers from the defense industry, space companies, and groups interested in methane detection, says Aguilar. “It’s pretty cool seeing the people knock on our door for this because I was just focusing on lidar,” he says.",

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-battery-material",
      "summary": "When Microsoft researchers in 2023 identified a new kind of material that could dramatically reduce the amount of lithium needed in rechargeable batteries, it felt like combing through a haystack in record time. That’s because their discovery began as 32 million possibilities and, with the help of artificial intelligence, produced a promising candidate within 80 hours. \nNow researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory plan to synthesize and test the novel material, NaxLi3−xYCl6,  in a battery setup. It’s one of several AI-generated battery chemistries making its way to the real world.\nMicrosoft’s experiment started when the researchers wanted to demonstrate how AI could tackle the needle-in-a-haystack problem of finding useful new materials and chemicals. They decided to seek new candidates for a rechargeable battery’s electrolyte, because a better electrolyte could make batteries safer while simultaneously improving performance, says Nathan Baker, project leader at Microsoft for Azure Quantum Elements, a program to accelerate chemistry and materials research through Microsoft’s advanced computing and AI platforms.\n“Our goal was to take one of these AI models and show the promise of accelerating scientific discovery—sifting through 32.5 million materials candidates and showing that we could do it in a matter of hours, not years,” Baker says. Their model, called the M3GNet framework, accelerated simulations of molecular dynamics to evaluate properties of the materials such as atomic diffusivity.\nFirst, the Microsoft researchers asked the model to drop new chemical elements into known crystalline structures in nature and determine which resulting molecules would be stable, a step that cut the 32 million starting candidates down to half a million. AI then screened those materials based on the necessary chemical abilities to make a battery work, which chopped the pool to just 800. From there, traditional computing and old-fashioned human expertise identified the novel material that could function within a battery and use 70 percent less lithium than the rechargeable batteries in commercial use today.\nAI’s Role in Next-Gen Battery Design\nThe Microsoft team isn’t alone. Around the world, researchers are busy trying to develop next-generation designs to replace or improve lithium-ion batteries, which use large quantities of rare, expensive, and difficult-to-acquire elements. New battery designs could use more abundant materials, reduce the fire danger from lithium-based liquid electrolytes, and pack more energy into a smaller space. The chemistries to do this are waiting out there to be discovered, and increasingly, researchers are harnessing AI and machine learning to do the work of sorting through the mountain of data. \n“We are teaching AI how to be a materials scientist,” says Dibakar Datta, associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, who published a study in August that used AI to identify five candidate materials for batteries that would outperform Li-ion. Datta’s team is working on the multivalent battery: one that employs multivalent ions that can carry multiple charge levels as opposed to the single charge carried by a lithium battery. \nThis would give the battery a greater energy storage capacity, but it also means working with larger ions from elements higher on the periodic table, like magnesium and calcium. Those larger ions won’t necessarily fit into existing battery designs without cracking or breaking the elements, Datta says. His new study used what he calls a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) that could propose new materials, and a large language model (LLM) that could find materials that would be the most stable in the real world. From a pool of millions of possibilities, the approach found five porous materials of the right size that could do the job.\nGuiding an AI model on its hunt through the nearly infinite space of possible materials is the tipping point in this field. The key to using it as a research partner is to find a happy medium between a model that works fast and a model that delivers perfectly accurate results, says Austin Sendek, professor at Stanford University who has developed algorithms to help AI discover new battery materials. \n“You have to traverse both breadth and depth,” says Sendek. Depth, because designing these things takes a lot of deep scientific knowledge about properties, engineering and chemistry, and breadth, because you have to apply that knowledge across an infinite chemical space, he says. “That’s where the promise of AI comes in.” \nAI Battery Technology Search at IBM\nResearchers at IBM have taken an AI-driven approach to identify new electrolyte candidates, which involved identifying chemical formulations with far higher electric conductivity than the lithium salts used in current batteries. A typical electrolyte can contain six to eight ingredients including salts, solvents, and additives, and it’s nearly impossible to consider all the combinations without AI. \nTo whittle down the field, the IBM team developed chemical foundation models trained on billions of molecules. “They capture the basic language of chemistry,” says Young-Hye Na, Principal Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Her team then trains those models with battery-related data so the AI can predict important properties for battery applications on scales from individual molecules all the way up to a whole device. Na described the work in a paper published in August in NPJ Computational Materials.\nBecause the work investigates new combinations of existing materials rather than using AI to invent exotic new materials, its potential to help build the battery of tomorrow is that much more promising, Na says. The IBM team is now collaborating with an undisclosed EV manufacturer to design high-performance electrolytes for high-voltage batteries.\nIBM’s use of AI for batteries isn’t limited to the hunt for promising materials. Typically, when AI reveals a promising new material, the next step is for experimentalists to synthesize the stuff, experiment with it in the lab, and one day to test it in a real device. Machine learning (ML) will aid researchers in this testing step, too. \nIBM is testing the real-world viability of new battery setups by building their digital twins—virtual models that allow the researchers to predict how a particular battery chemistry would degrade over a lifetime of countless power cycles. The model, developed in collaboration with battery startup Sphere Energy, can predict a battery’s long-term behavior in as few as 50 power cycles modeled on the digital twin, says Teodoro Laino, distinguished research staff member at IBM Research.\nQuantum Computing Batteries\nThe next phase of AI battery research is quantum. As Microsoft and IBM push toward the potential of quantum computers, both see its promise to model complex chemistry with no shortcuts or compromises. Na says that while current AI is a crucial tool for investigating battery chemistry, the next step—modeling whole EV battery packs, for example, and taking into consideration all the variables they encounter in the real world—would require the power of quantum computing. \nAs Baker puts it: “We know classical computers have problems generating accurate answers for complex substances, complex molecules, complex materials. So our goal right now is actually to change the way the data is generated by bringing quantum into the loop so that we have higher accuracy data for training ML models.”",

      "summary": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by IP.com\nAround the world, innovation is no longer just a function of invention. It is a strategic asset, deeply linked to economic resilience—and increasingly reliant on ever-evolving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). As intellectual property ecosystems transform under this new reality, the need for advanced, efficient, ethical AI-supported innovation infrastructure has never been more urgent.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has emerged as a global leader in this space, signaling its commitment to responsible AI leadership through the AI and Emerging Technologies (ET) Partnership, and most recently, through its landmark guidance clarifying that human contribution is essential for inventorship in AI-assisted creations and its significant investment in deploying AI to improve prior art searches and overall examination quality.\n  \nAs governments, enterprises, and inventors look to chart a path through this rapidly shifting IP landscape, one innovation intelligence company has been boldly helping lead the way: IP.com.\nFor over 20 years, IP.com has worked to empower public and private innovation stakeholders alike with an ever-expanding suite of AI-powered tools that enhance ideation, evaluate novelty, clarify patent landscapes, and protect inventive work around the globe.\nToday, as the world rethinks how to balance open innovation with strategic security, IP.com’s solutions are not only timely—they are essential.\n\nAligning A National Vision with Global Innovation \nWhile each country faces its own innovation challenges and opportunities, there is a growing consensus around one idea: the systems that support innovation—including those for AI and intellectual property—must be modern, data-driven, future-ready, and responsible.\nThat vision was echoed in the U.S. government’s recent Executive Order on artificial intelligence (EO 14179), and the newly published “America’s AI Action Plan” which emphasize the need for safe and trustworthy AI systems to drive economic growth and national security. While the Executive Order speaks primarily to U.S. priorities, it reflects a global movement toward building responsible AI systems that deliver long-term value, foster trust, and safeguard the integrity of innovation.\nIP.com’s innovation platforms are deeply aligned with this broader call, providing AI solutions that are secure and responsible from the ground up.

The homework assignments are available here, and lecture notes are available here.\nThe lectures are intended for those who want to do research on the learning-theoretic agenda and need to catch-up on the necessary background knowledge. As complementary resources, consider looking into my MATS lectures, the LTA reading list and the (not quite finished) sequence on infra-Bayesianism by @Brittany Gelb.\nIf you feel ready to start with actual research, consider applying to my track in the PIBBSS fellowship.\nPrivacy note: According to what I know, everyone who appear in the recording consented to the recording becoming available online. However, if there was some mistake, s.t. you are in the recording but don't want to be there, DM me and I will take it down ASAP.\nH/t to my beloved spouse @Marcus Ogren for placing the lectures on YouTube.\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 10:03 PM GMT\n\nWhilst cycling today, I remembered that when reading Mark Kac's autobiography, Enigmas of Change, which is truly fantastic, his search for the meaning of probabilistic independence struck me as massive. What would it even mean to understand independence at a deep level? It's just P(A,B) = P(A)P(B), surely? The biography didn't truly answer that question for me, but it did gesture at what a deeper understanding might look like.\nWhich then reminded me that there was a famous analysis of the definition of equality in mathematics. So I figured, now's as good a time as any to get deeply confused about the most basic concept in mathematics. And I succeeded. \nFirst off, a brush-up with equality. What's the standard definition? Well, it's a binary, reflexive, symmetric and transitive relationship. Or, at least, that's what an equivalence relation is. You can get a trivial equivalence relationship: everything's equivalent to everything else. Not selective enough to define equality. \nOK, maybe if we look at some other definitions of equality we can get a grip on it? In set theory, you say that two sets are equal if they've got the same elements. How do you know the elements are the same i.e. equal? You just know. \nMaybe that comes from first order logic? How's equality defined there? Same as above, except there's for two big old schemas of properties it satisfies.

Second, \nx=y→ϕ(...,x,...)→(ϕ(...,y,...))\nfor any property ϕ we can cook up in our logic's syntax. \nIn other words, if x=y, then they can substitute for one another in anything we do to them. \nWhich is a heck of a lot more oomph than just saying equality is an equivalence relation. But now I'm less confused. I've undone all my hard work. I'll have to look at more definitions to remedy the situation. \nOK, what about in category theory? There, the notion of equality depends on context. (And in type theory.) For in a category (objects plus maps between them) two objects are equal iff there is an isomorphism between them. That is, X=Y implies there is some Y\">g:X−>Y with a corresponding inverse s.t. \ng−1∘g=IdX,g∘g−1=IdY.\nLet me give an example. Take a category of shapes, but with only continuous functions between them. Then, a sphere and a cube are isomorphic to one another, i.e. they are equal. Wait, what?\nYes, a cube and a sphere are equal to one another if you only have continuous maps available to you. For the purposes of continuous maps, the distances between things don't matter, only topology. And a cube and a sphere have the same topology.\nBut if you enrich the category with some more discriminating maps, say distance preserving ones, then the sphere and cube are no longer equal. Conversely, if you reduce the category by removing all the isomorphisms between the sphere and the cube, then they are no longer equal. \nThis is what I meant by equality being contextual in category theory. Two objects may or may not be equal, depending on the category they're in. You can go to a \"bigger\" category and make two objects unequal. Or you can go to a smaller category and make them unequal.\nBut that doesn't make sense. In a theory in first order logic, whether two things are equal or not also depends on the context i.e. the axioms of the and theory you're working with. For instance, are the symbols \"1\" = \"2\" in first order logic? Depends on the axioms! You may not be able to prove it either way if the axioms are weak enough. Which is certainly the case if your theory has no axioms, except for the logical axioms assumed by the logic itself. \nIf you add some axioms and strengthen the theory, then you could get equality or inequality. But once you have it, adding axioms can't change whether two things are equal or not. At least, not without running into contradictions?\nSo what gives? Why is equality in category theory more \"flexible\" than of first order logic? And have I remystified equality for myself?\nIn both cases, equality is reflexive, symmetric, transitive and binary. In both cases, if two objects are equal, then you can substitute them for one another in any operation and wind up with equivalent results. \nIs it just that you can have many different equalities between objects in category theory? Is it some weird feature of the semantics of the theory? My current guess is that the equivalent of the axiom schemas for equality from FOL in category theory are all the statements like g−1∘g=IdX,g∘g−1=IdY. We can add/remove any of these conditions (except when X = Id_X\">g:X−>X=IdX) from the category. But we can't do the same for the axiom schemas in FOL. And that's why they're more rigid. \nSo confusion dissolved? Well, at least until I tackle equality in programming. \n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 9:49 PM GMT\n\nWindows, Mirrors, and Lenses: On Intentional Prose\nWhat is writing style? Is it a) an expression of your personality, a mysterious, innate quality, or b) simply a collection of tips and tricks? I have found both framings helpful, but ultimately unsatisfactory. Clear and Simple as The Truth, by Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner, presents a simple, coherent, alternative. The book helps me cohere many loosely connected ideas on writing, and writing styles, in my head.\nFor Thomas and Turner, a mature writing style is defined by making a principled choice on a small number of nontrivial central issues: truth, presentation, cast, scene, and the intersection of thought & language.\nThey present 8 writing styles: classic, reflexive, practical, plain, contemplative, romantic, prophetic, and oratorical.\nThe book argues for what they call the classic style, and teaches you how to write classically. While no doubt useful for many readers, my extended review will take a different approach. Rather than championing one approach, I’ll inhabit each style on its own terms, with greater focus on the more common styles in contemporary writing, before weighing their respective strengths and limitations, particularly when it comes to nonfiction internet writing.\n\n \nWriting as different screens. Image generated with Google Nano Banana\nClassic style: A Clear Window for Seeing Truth\nClassic style presents truth through transparent prose. The writer has observed something clearly and shows it to the reader, who is treated as an equal capable of seeing the same truth once properly oriented. The prose itself remains almost invisible, a clear window through which one views the subject. Taken as a whole, a good passage in classic style can be seen as beautiful, but it is a subtle, understated beauty.\nAt heart, Classic style assumes that truth exists independently and can be perceived clearly by a competent observer. The truth is pure, with an obvious, awestriking quality to itself, above mere mortal men who can only perceive it. The job of the writer is to identify and convey the objective truth, no more and no less.\nProse is a clear window. While the truth the writer wants to show you may be stunning, the writer’s means of showing it is always straightforward, neither bombastic nor underhanded. The writing should be transparent, not calling attention to itself. Unlike a stained glass window, which is ornate but unclear, good classic writing allows you to see the objective truth of the content beyond the writing.\nIn classic style, writer and reader are equals in a conversation. The writer is presenting observations to someone equally capable of understanding them. The writer and reader are both equal, but elite. They are elite not through genetic endowment nor other accidents of birth, but through focused training and epistemic merit. In Confucian terms, they’re junzi, though focused on cultivation of epistemic rather than relational virtues.\nA core component of classic style is clarity through simplicity. Complex ideas should be expressed in the simplest possible terms without sacrificing precision. Difficulty should come from the subject matter, not the expression.\nClassic style further assumes that for any thought, there exists an ideal expression that captures it completely and elegantly. The writer’s job is to find it. In classic style, every word counts. There are no wasted phrases, nor dangling metaphors. While skimming classic style is possible, you are always missing important information in doing so. Aristotle’s dictum on story endings – surprising but inevitable – applies recursively to every sentence, paragraph, and passage in classic style.\nFinally, in classic style, thought precedes writing. The thinking is always complete before the writing begins. Like a traditional mathematical proof, the prose presents finished thoughts, and hides the process of thinking.\n\n \nSource: https://www.bobsglass.com/6-common-types-of-glass-for-windows\nClassic writing samples\n \nGood versions of classic style appear pretty rare in the internet age. Of all the writers I regularly read, only two writers jump out to me as writing in mostly classic style: Paul Graham and Ted Chiang.\nThe classic style serves their subjects well. Graham’s natural domain is fairly abstract advice on startups. Much of early-stage startup ethos can be described impolitely as a confidence game, or more neutrally as a reality distortion field, with the founder selling his highly contentious and idiosyncratic vision to funders and early employees as if it were an inevitable truth. In that context, the simplicity, understated beauty, and self-assuredness of classic style fits perfectly.\nIn contrast, while Chiang isn’t selling you something, many of his science fiction stories strive for a timeless, ethereal quality, sometimes quite literally. In that philosophical context, classic style, with its beautiful yet muted quality, serves the timeless philosophical science fiction of Chiang well.\nAmong my own writings, the surface level of Open Asteroid Impact is written in classic style. The complete confidence, lack of self-doubt, and an entire website fully “played straight” helps sell the illusion of a Serious Startup completely immune to either critique or self-awareness, and amplifies the inevitability of doom.\nClassic style is very much not my natural style. My first serious attempt to write in unironic classic style is in the coda of my recent post on Intellectual Jokes. My coda is not the purest instantiation of classic style, but I think it does the job well enough.\nUnfortunately, there are many bastardizations of classic style online, which tries to emulate many of the surface qualities of classic style without paying the dues of a careful attention towards truth and deliberate, yet concealed effort. The “LinkedIn Bro” style of writing, including the “Thought Leadership” and “Tech Guru” variants, is a common such bastardization.\nClassic Style in the Age of the Internet\nHonestly I think classic style is just a bad fit for the internet. An underrated downside of classic style is that, more than pretty much any common style of writing, doing it well is just insanely high effort. A central tenet of classic style is presentation: the writing should look smooth and effortless. But this effortlessness is almost always a mirage, like an Instagram model who spends three hours in front of a mirror to apply the “just woke up”, au naturel, “no makeup makeup” look.\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence that both Chiang and Graham are very unprolific, and both talk about how hard it is to write well, and how many edits they go through.\nIn contrast, writing fast and churning out a lot of content is central to success as an internet writer, so it behooves would-be internet writers to find a style that works for them that is less demanding on the need for many rounds of revisions.\nThat said, I think people underrate the value of practicing and thinking in classic style, even if you chose to ultimately discard it, or not write serious posts in that style. Especially if, like me, you find the classic style alien to your normal writing sensibilities. Forcing yourself to write in that way, unironically, and inhabiting the style in its own lights, and especially doing it in a way that doesn’t leave you unsatisfied in the end, is a great way to grow and improve as a writer, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of your own style of writing.\nIf you want to write more in the classic style, I recommend reading Clear and Simple as The Truth. Thomas and Turner spend more time discussing the classic style than every other style combined, and have exercises. I’ve also heard good things about Steven Pinker’s The Sense of Style.\nPlain Style\nOr: Just the facts, ma’am!\nPlain style is simple and unadorned.\nPlain style has no opinion about truth beyond its existence. Truth isn’t beautiful or complex or subjective or hidden. It’s just there. “The meeting is at 3pm.” “Turn left at the light.” “My password is hunter2.” These truths don’t require contemplation.\nPlain style doesn’t explain why. It doesn’t justify. It doesn’t persuade. The meeting is at 3pm. That’s all you need to know.\nUnlike classic style’s epistemic elitism, plain style is democratic. Everyone can write it. Everyone can read it. Writer and reader are equals, and normal people, not elites. The writer happens to know something the reader doesn’t. The writer wants to communicate it quickly and efficiently.\nThe central scene in plain style is a congregation of a Society of Friends. Because the truth is obvious, anybody can find it. Children often find it first. They haven’t learned to complicate things.\nPlain style is as sparse as possible. It is almost never beautiful. On the occasions when writing in the plain style seems beautiful, the beauty comes not from words but their absence.\n\nThe man sits in the corner of the bar. He fidgets with his ring finger. He orders a fifth shot of vodka. He looks away when the bartender pours. He drinks. He fidgets again.\n\nPlain writing samples\nHemingway writes in this style. To a lesser extent, so does Orwell. Much of news journalism is in this style. Among speculative fiction writers I like, I think Suzanne Collins writes the most in this style.\nI believe much of internet writing approaches this style, though not quite the extreme level of sparsity as the example above. Unfortunately it’s not a particularly common style among writers I personally enjoy reading. Dan Luu I think comes closest, though in his case the simplicity of prose is counterbalanced by the sheer density of content.\nPlain Style in the Age of the Internet\nI think this is a strong contender for a barebones style to aim for, if you’re not sure what style to write in! Unlike classic style or reflexive style, the skill floor is fairly low. So as long as you have interesting things to say, presenting them in plain style is perfectly serviceable, unlike one of the more ornate and/or harder to pull off styles.\n\n \nSource: https://www.fca.gov/required-notices/plain-writing\nTop 7 Tips to Write in the Practical Style\n\nKnow your audience. Practical style helps readers accomplish specific tasks efficiently. To do this, the most important rule of writing in the practical style is knowing who you are writing to, what are they trying to accomplish, and catering to your audience appropriately. Nothing is more important than your reader and their goals.\nKnow your shit. The second most important rule of writing in the practical style is knowing what you’re talking about. The only way to efficiently communicate useful knowledge to your reader is by actually knowing useful things to communicate. The “central scene” of the practical style is a seasoned master teaching an apprentice something the master knows deeply.\nLearn the mechanics of how people in your audience normally communicate, and emulate it. For presentation, don’t reinvent the wheel stylistically - write in formats your audience already uses.\nStructure your writing explicitly, and in styles that your readers are likely to be familiar with. Use headers, bullet points, listicles.\nUse verbs. Write in simple, imperative sentences. Instead of ‘The system can be configured’ write ‘Configure the system’.\nTest your writing with users. Don’t just theorize about what impacts your writing might have on theoretical readers, actually have beta readers in your intended audience to test your writings with, and ask for explicit user feedback.\nLearn explicitly from people who teach how to write in the practical style. Strunk&White is a common go-to reference. Williams and Colomb are also recommended by experts. You can also learn from online masters.\n\nPractical writing samples\nWikihow is the purest online example. Online guides to getting things done are often in this style. Instruction manuals are also in this style, and to a lesser extent, some academic writings will be in a hybrid of this style and a different style (most frequently reflexive).\n\n \nSource: https://www.wikihow.com/Write\nPractical Style in the Age of the Internet\nI think this style has its place when you’re teaching a specific thing, especially if it’s know-how rather than know-that. I don’t have strong opinions on whether it’s underdone or overdone at the current moment.\nI suspect some of my past writings should be ported over to practical style, e.g. forecasting and grantmaking lessons. One day!\nReflexive style (or is it self-aware style?)\nEpistemic status: Moderately confident\nThis is a family of styles that Thomas and Turner do not much like, but is very common in academic writing and internet writing, particularly rationalist and EA writing (which is the discursive tradition I’m perhaps the most familiar with). The family of styles (For simplicity I will from now on refer to the entire family of styles as “it”, “the style,” and “this style”, notwithstanding significant heterogeneity in the family of styles) are archetypically very self-referential. Unlike with other styles, you do not forget that the specific reader, and especially the specific writer exists, and you are reading a specific piece of writing with a specific purpose.\nThanks for reading The Linchpin! This post is public so please free to share it.\nShare\nPinker (somewhat derisively) calls this style the postmodernist style. Thomas and Turner (somewhat inaccurately) call it the reflexive style. After discussing with friends, reading articles online, and some self-deliberation, I think “self-conscious” or “self-aware” style captures it best.\nThe tone might be performatively uncertain, anxious, and apologetic. “In my humble opinion”, “It appears that”, “in my reading of the passage,”, “the data weakly suggests”, “while we cannot fully comprehend providence”, “in my personal, limited experience as a privileged [identity-group marker]”, “epistemic status: uncertain.”\nWhile perhaps tiresome to read, the qualifiers have both epistemic and ritualistic benefits. Epistemically, they facilitate reasoning transparency and help the reader understand and grasp the state of current understanding, and how the writer comes to believe what they believe. Ritualistically, they help the reader and writer situate themselves in a pre-established epistemic and social hierarchy for ideas, to help qualify the social positioning of such ideas.\nBut I worry I’m being too abstract here. Does that make sense? Let me try a different framing: self-aware style often encodes power structures. For example, in the academic variant, graduate students may hedge more than more senior scholars, and assistant and adjunct professors can be more prone to hedging than tenured professors. Women scholars also tend to hedge more than male scholars, though it’s not clear to me how much of this is due to social pressure versus temperament1.\nThe historical and genealogical view of self-aware styles is also telling. Often, academic-adjacent communities rise up against the self-aware style. For example, early LessWrong and GiveWell tend to be written in simpler, more conversational prose. They see the self-aware style as overwrought, non-parsimonious, and conversational poison. And yet, they eventually settle on their own variants of the self-aware style, just with slightly different types of hedges and tribal markers.\nPerhaps most interestingly, different members of the family of self-aware styles express different non-classic notions of truth, whether objective truth or our ability to access it. Science academia’s hedging and reflexivity may convey a notion of truth as provisional, contingent, and falsifiable. Modern humanities academia’s self-awareness may embody truth as subjective, socially constructed, and mediated by power. Rationalist hedging may encode truth as probabilistic, uncertain, and limited by cognitive biases (72% certain). And in all three, truth is seen as primarily collaborative and interpreted in light of our theories and models, rather than directly observed and presented.\nSelf-aware styles may see other styles on this list, including classic style, as naive, arrogant, and lacking in self-awareness. In contrast, the other styles may see self-aware styles as confusing, overly self-obsessed, and annoying to wade through.\n\n \nMC Escher, Drawing Hands\nReflexive writing samples\nI think my “The Motivated Reasoning Critique of Effective Altruism” article is a perfect example of writing in this genre. Much of LessWrong and the EA Forum is written in this way. If you want more examples, much of academic writing is in this vein, especially in the humanities and non-econ, non-psychology, social sciences.\nReflexive Style in the Age of the Internet\nMy biggest reflection from writing this piece is that reflexive/self-aware style is overdone in the internet era, especially in the “smart parts” of the internet. There are many good and bad reasons for this, including genealogical reasons, defensive writing being necessary in the context of aggressive quote-tweeting culture, and speed-reading and reasoning transparency being at a premium in an adversarial epistemic culture. But in my opinion a big reason is just what Paul Graham calls “scar tissue” – every little critique or self-critique nudges the writing culture to be a little more defensive, and a little more self-aware.\nOne contentious point I have: Self-aware style sees itself as humble, epistemically modest. And in some sense this is surely true. But in another, just as important sense, I think of the self-aware style’s central conceit as very arrogant, especially in the internet era. After all, the single most conceited thing an internet writer can regularly do is hit “publish” on their own thoughts. And by having your discursive tendencies, uncertainty, and self-doubts “on air,” you’re implicitly saying that not only are your factual analyses and insights important enough to be read by dozens, thousands, or millions of people, but your neuroses are as well.\nBut even with all my reflections and criticisms aside, I still considered the self-aware style and derivatives to be an important part of modern intellectual internet writing, and I expect a nontrivial number of my future pieces to still primarily be in this style.\nIf you want to write well in a self-aware style without going overboard, I recommend reading Luke on Reasoning Transparency. Many style guides on academic writing can also be helpful here.\nStyles for Special Occasions\nThe remaining styles are less frequent in internet writing, especially in “pure” form. I will be briefer in both my inhabitation of these styles, and in the follow-up discussion.\nContemplative style: Writing as Lens\nWhat do I think about when I think about writing? I often wonder this to myself. But first, what is writing? What is the essence of it, the ur-, Platonic form? Is it a conversation between equals, like in classic style? Is it dispassionate and efficient information transfer, in plain style? Or is there no platonic form at all, just different modes for different times, whatever is most practically relevant? Or is writing an apology for my own positionality and biases? Who’s to say? I find these thoughts hard to think about. And even though I pride myself on my cognitive capacities, I’ve found it hard to turn my thoughts inwards, like a lens that looks too deeply at itself. What does it mean to write? To think? I often find excogitating on the page easier than genuine introspection, and today, alas, is no exception.\nThe core of contemplative style is thought in action. The archetypal writing in this style has two components: a presentation of an object or event under study, and then a meditative reflection of what the event means to the writer. The archetypal scene of a contemplative style is a solitary thinker in his diary, or on a walk. The presentation component can be done classically, plainly, or practically, but in contemplative style, that’s not what matters. Rather, reflection is the better half: the writer is working through his thoughts, and wants to showcase them to the reader.\nThis style has found surprising, if niche, success online, particularly in newsletter culture where readers subscribe specifically for a writer’s thought process. Annie Dillard and Maria Popova often write in this style. To a lesser extent, Ada Palmer and Scott Alexander often use elements of this style, with an objective description/summary of something first and then a reflective analysis, though the analysis tends to be more outwardly focused.2 See Gupta on Enlightenment for a more traditional example, and My Heart of Hearts for a less traditional one. Finally, the more cerebral book reviews are often partially in this style.\nRomantic Style: Writing as Ornate Mirror\nSometimes I hate writing. I hate, hate, hate it! I hate how difficult it can be. I hate the blank page. I hate how much I identify with my own words, and how much I try and fail to be dispassionate. I hate how tough it is to get a clear thought across on the page. I hate the problem of other minds, and the related problem of true understanding. I hate the clickbaitiness, the artifice, the strong self-driven need to say something original counterbalanced by external pressures to perform. I hate how increasingly good the AIs are at writing, and one day – maybe one day soon – they’ll completely supersede me.\nI love writing! I love love love it! I love it as an expression of my soul. I love it as a conduit across the world, and across time. I love writing to subscribers in India, and haters in New Zealand. I love the references, the quotes, the craft, the meta-cognition, the sheer beauty of this art that I share with the great rhetoricians of the past and future. I love how I see myself in Nanni’s customer service complaints about Ea-nāṣir, and perhaps one day my distant digital great-grandchildren could see themselves through my substack notes and preserved screenshots of my embarrassing DMs. I love the cliches, the dance, the tangled world-webs we weave. I love how writing allowed a young Chinese boy in a foreign land to find his voice, and navigate a ferociously confusing external era and internal world. I love writing. Every line is a love letter to my younger and older selves, and perhaps to you.\nThe romantic style is emotional, raw, unfiltered. Unlike classic style’s conception of writing as a window, or contemplative style self-conception as a lens that sometimes can be turned on itself, the romantic style is always a mirror. It sees styles like the classic and plain styles as sterile, emotionless, and ultimately false in that they ignore the deeper emotional reality for a less interesting external world. It sees the contemplative style likewise as too much brain and insufficient heart. Romantic style is the Humean notion “reason is a slave of the passions” in art form. Romantic style writing is never about “The Truth”, but always your truth.\nI don’t personally read much prose in romantic style these days, but I like older and modern poetry in this style, of which my favorite might be Sylvia Plath’s work, particularly Mad Girl’s Love Song. An interesting example of ”antiromantic” style might be Sam Kriss, which takes on romantic style’s subjectivity and emotional tenor, but the primary emotion he chooses to evoke in an audience isn’t “pure” emotions like love, honor, pride, or even hatred and despair, but disgust.\nProphetic Style: The Truth that Burns\nWhat is writing? Thou asked, and I shall answer. Writing, the Muses tell me, is about the Good and the Real. Every Prophet hears the Gods in different ways. Whether it’s Biblical hermeneutics, racial consciousness, omens, portent dreams, direct lived experience, or careful expected utility calculations, when Good and Real speak to you in clarion calls, you must listen. And you must repeat their calls.\nThe Truth is not transparent, not provisional, not personal. It is urgent, moral, and inescapable.\nWhen you speak The Truth, it bursts through the text in whitehot flames, incandescent, burning with ease through lies, tired excuses, and mere practicality. The Prophecy is not beautiful in the classic sense; it is awful, in the Old meaning of the word: it inspires awe, fear, and sometimes repentance. Your sentences are not crafted to be elegant; they are forged to be unignorable.\nProphecies are largely not crafted to be epistemic, reflective, or practical. To the extent they serve a directly useful purpose, it’s usually as a coordination mechanism. Most interestingly, the prophetic style and the previous styles discussed diverges in the external ensemble. While every other style has some important gradation of writer vs reader (eg readers and writers are equals in classic and plain style, reader is elevated in practical style, writer is elevated in contemplative and romantic style), the most important party in the Prophetic style is an external party to both writer and reader: God(s), Ethnic Consciousness, or Utility.\nModern day examples of true prophetic style are relatively rare. Outside of religious examples, I mostly see them in essays and rap songs about racial consciousness, of which recent examples include works of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Kendrick Lamar. Meditations on Moloch by Scott Alexander is also significantly in this style, as are some entreaties against factory farming. (When I asked for examples of modern prophetic-style writings, people often hallucinate AI “doomer” content as prophetic, but if you drill down into the specific style, I’ve yet to find AI risk articles actually written in this way. Comment if you have examples!).\n\n \nProphet Lamar, from https://y105music.com/kendrick-lamars-damn-album-double-platinum/\nOratorical style: Subscribe Now, Friends and Countrymen!\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, wanderers of the word-hungry web—lend me your scroll-weary eyes!

Subscribe today!\n[subscribe button]\nThe oratorical style thrives on performance and persuasion, treating prose as a stage where writer becomes speaker, addressing an audience that must be moved to action. It’s unabashedly theatrical, wielding rhythm, repetition, and rhetorical flourishes as weapons of mass conviction. Works in oratorical style, even when written, are meant to be read and heard out loud. Where classic style hides its effort, oratorical style revels in it. The sweat on the speaker’s brow is part of the show.\nI’m personally not aware of modern internet writings written primarily in oratorical style, at least in the corners of the internet I frequent.\n \nFinding Your Voice in the Cacophony\nInhabiting each style has been a difficult but enlightening experience. I will gladly do so again. I’ve learned a lot about each writing styles’ strengths and limitations, as well as that of my native styles.\nMy number one advice for readers interested in elevating their internet writing craft is to not think of style as a single thing to master, or about finding a singular good fit for your personality. Instead, experiment, as I did, with different styles, so you can more deeply appreciate their strengths and limitations.\nIn the context of the internet, I think we can learn a lot from almost all of these styles. From classic style, we can learn the value of conveying clarity, timelessness, and inevitability in prose form. From plain style, we can learn the value of facts and simplicity. From practical style, we can learn the value of extreme audience awareness and elevating the reader above the writer. From contemplative style, we can learn the value of demarcating a clean separation between reporting on objective reality and discussing our subjective reflections. And so forth.\nUltimately, contra Thomas and Turner, I believe it is a good practice for you to let your content and message drive your style of writing. Rather than developing a specific “personal style”, you may find it helpful to develop several styles that’s a good fit for you, and decide between them for the stories and essays you want to write.\nIf you want to convey a clear, timeless, and inevitable idea, go with classic style or one of its derivatives. If you just want to share simple facts, plain style is a great choice. If you want to provide useful instructions for your reader, and minimize accompanying discussions, go with practical style. And if you’re genuinely uncertain, and want to present a truth that’s provisional, probabilistic, and tentative, you may want to choose a variant of the reflexive style.\nBut when you do sit down to write a specific article: commit to something. Strive to aim for stylistic coherence and consistency. Style isn’t just about surface features like spelling or vocabulary choices, or even the broader vibe. Style is about making a principled choice on the key issues – truth, presentation, cast, scene, and the intersection of thought & language – and maintaining it throughout your article. I think you should stick to that.\nUnless, of course, the essay demands otherwise. All writing rules are ultimately guidelines, and the best writers know when to break them.\nIn a future (hopefully shorter) post, I might discuss internet essayists I respect the most. I’d like to cover internet-fluent writers, who are able to mix and match from the above styles to deliver a consistent experience that’s a great fit for the current age. Especially Scott Alexander, a master of the craft whose writing style has spanned a number of competitor styles, perhaps including my own. I’m also interested in covering internet-native writers, whose writing styles are only possible on the modern internet, like multimedia microsite essay style, the wiki-garden style, the tweetstorm style, and so forth.\nIn the meantime, experiment!

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 9:20 PM GMT\n\nThere's a bit of an implicit norm that has accumulated over the past few years, but inconsistently, and AFAICT no one has publicly argued for it. \nSometimes, when arguing online, you will notice yourself going into a mode that is more like a rant than like careful arguing. Or, you know is not really passing your interlocutor's Intellectual Turing Test. Or, you know is psychologizing someone, and there's decent odds you're wrong (perhaps only in a subtle way that isn't core to your point but is going to feel violating to the person you're psychologizing).\nSometimes, the correct action is \"just don't do those things.\"\nSometimes, IMO, the correct action is \"do those things, but carefully.\"\nSometimes, IMO, the theoretically ideal correct action all-else-equal is \"do those things carefully\", but you're busy and it's realistically a choice between \"do them uncarefully\" or \"don't do it at all\", and it's actually better to do it uncarefully than not-at-all.\nIn such case, I think it's noticeably better to include a short disclaimer like \"I recognize I am being uncharitable right now, and maybe am wrong about this, and am sorry.\"\nThe \"I may be wrong\" and \"I'm sorry\" parts are both pretty useful (especially if you don't have established trust with the interlocutor)\nThe first, because it's true (it's generally a good epistemic move to have at least two real hypotheses, and if you don't, IMO you should regard your conclusion as sus). The second, because uncareful rants and uncareful psychologizing and uncharitable paraphrases do have a decent chance of damaging the epistemic commons (not merely hurting people's feelings). \n\"Rudeness\" is a useful concept. It's a way of agreeing \"here are some actions that people will realistically do sometimes, sometimes for good reasons, but, it would be bad if people did them willy-nilly.\" It sets incentives better IMO if the expectation is \"if you do the rude thing, you do take some reputational hit, and if you do it too much without somehow making up for it, longterm consequences will accumulate.\"\n(Title of this post should probably actually be something like: \"</costlyButOwnedRantThatIAcceptResponsibilityFor>\", to bake the responsibility more into the meme. But, that title sucks and I haven't thought of a better one.\nI think it's a reasonable counterargument to some previous-debates-about-norms, that \"adding friction to people thinking out loud is often way, way, worse than you might naively expect.\" But, I think adding a quick disclaimer is just not that hard. \nI think this is a useful thing to do even if there's not a coordinated social norm about it. But, I do separately think it'd be good if it were considered \"extra rude\" to do uncareful rants, and uncharitable psychologizing, without briefly noting them as such.\nSee: Generalized Hangriness: A Standard Rationalist Stance Toward Emotions.\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 9:09 PM GMT\n\nI think alignment by itself is complex phenomenon, but big part of it is sharing the same, or similar ethics.\nAnd ethics itself is also very complex phenomenon and often fuzzy and inconsistent, but to a certain approximation from a certain perspective, I see a lot of ethics in big part as software protocol evolved by evolution for mutual cooperation between \"same enough kinds\".\nAnd different ethical frameworks define \"same enough kind\" differently, like if you include people from your neighborhood, country, earth, ideology, personality cluster, interests cluster, etc., or also animals (also which animals you include and exclude), more aligned or less aligned AGIs, etc., in your ethics as someone you want to cooperate with.\nYou can cooperate more locally or more globally depending on how big is your circle and kinds of people or entities in general you cooperate with, or on a smaller or bigger timescale to collectively survive. You can use a lot of methods for that, like for example maximizing of overall good in utilitarianism, which can potentially be to a certain degree quantified over time (like in a lot of Effective Altruism), or following some formal rules/duties in deontology. Which I think can have some approximated formal basis to it in more forms.\nBut I think a lot of people also operate more on fluid vibes that are hard to ground in some formalism, but there's still a lot of cooperation involved.\n\nDiscuss",

This works especially well for:\n\nPeople who work elsewhere but occasionally visit SF and want a place to work\nThose who have offices but want access to a community space on evenings and weekends\nAnyone looking to exchange ideas with other folks working on AI safety\n\nWhile in the space, guest program members are full Mox members. They’re welcome to join members-only events and to access our amenities, including conference rooms, desks with monitors, abundant snacks and drinks, a gym, a nap room, and ~more.\nApplications for full Mox membership by guest program members will also be fast-tracked for consideration.\nWhy we’re doing this\nMox exists to help people exchange ideas and build community around important work. We’ve already hosted people from organizations like METR, PIBBSS, Elicit and others for coworking and events; we’d love to expand this to more people working on AI safety and related fields.\nWhat people say about Mox\nI think of people at Mox as a collection of my friends and not-yet-friends. Nobody feels entirely like a stranger. Mox members are (of course) smart, but they’re also so open and approachable. I can walk up to anyone and have an interesting conversation; every single person I’ve met here has welcomed questions about their work and been curious about mine.\n— Gavriel Kleinwaks, Mox member\nMox was an amazing space for the AI for Epistemics hackathon. I loved the thoughtful layout with central communal gathering areas and quiet work areas around the edges, easily enough space for the 40+ participants.\n— Andreas Stuhlmüller, Elicit\nMox has the best density of people with the values & capabilities I care about the most. In general, it’s more social & feels better organized for serendipity vs any coworking space I’ve been to before, comparable to perhaps like 0.3 Manifests per month.\n— Venki Kumar, Mox member\nAustin and his staff have gone to great lengths to make Mox incredibly accommodating. Not only is the space already equipped with useful things like utensils, printers, and AV, but the operational staff are communicative, flexible, and incredibly helpful.... I definitely hope to find occasions to host more events at Mox down the line, and would highly recommend it to anyone I know who is looking for a slightly more casual, but exceedingly well-managed venue.\n— Xander Balwit, Asimov Press\nMox is a spacious and welcoming coworking space, with kind, helpful staff. We would be happy to host an event there again.\n— Sawyer Bernath, Tarbell Fellowship\nHow to join\nIf you run an organization working on AI safety and want to partner with us, email robin@moxsf.com to discuss. We’re also great for hosting talks, hackathons, retreats, and fellowships.\nIf you’re an individual working on AI safety and affiliated with one of our partner organizations, reach out to your org about accessing the guest program.\nIf you’re visiting from out of town and work on AI safety, feel free to reach out! We’re especially interested in connecting with folks from DC, London, and other hubs.\n \nPartner with Mox\n\n \n\nMox is located in San Francisco and serves as both a coworking space and incubator for people working on important problems.

      "title": "Claude Sonnet 4.5 Is A Very Good Model",
      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/spQh5JfWXqTE5x5Wi/claude-sonnet-4-5-is-a-very-good-model",
      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 6:00 PM GMT\n\nA few weeks ago, Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.1 and promised larger announcements within a few weeks. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the larger announcement.\nYesterday I covered the model card and related alignment concerns.\nToday’s post covers the capabilities side.\nWe don’t currently have a new Opus, but Mike Krieger confirmed one is being worked on for release later this year. For Opus 4.5, my request is to give us a second version that gets minimal or no RL, isn’t great at coding, doesn’t use tools well except web search, doesn’t work as an agent or for computer use and so on, and if you ask it for those things it suggests you hand your task off to its technical friend or does so on your behalf.\n\n\n\n\nI do my best to include all substantive reactions I’ve seen, positive and negative, because right after model releases opinions and experiences differ and it’s important to not bias one’s sample.\n\n\n\n\nBig Talk\nHere is Anthropic’s official headline announcement of Sonnet 4.5. This is big talk, calling it the best model in the world for coding, computer use and complex agent tasks.\nThat isn’t quite a pure ‘best model in the world’ claim, but it’s damn close.\nWhatever they may have said or implied in the past, Anthropic is now very clearly willing to aggressively push forward the public capabilities frontier, including in coding and other areas helpful to AI R&D.\nThey’re also offering a bunch of other new features, including checkpoints and a native VS Code extension for Claude Code.\nAnthropic: Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in the world. It’s the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.\nCode is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.\nThis is the most aligned frontier model we’ve ever released, showing large improvements across several areas of alignment compared to previous Claude models.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use claude-sonnet-4-5 via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same as Claude Sonnet 4, at $3/$15 per million tokens.\n\n\n\nThe Big Takeaways\nDoes Claude Sonnet 4.5 look to live up to that hype?\nMy tentative evaluation is a qualified yes. This is likely a big leap in some ways.\nIf I had to pick one ‘best coding model in the world’ right now it would be Sonnet 4.5.\nIf I had to pick one coding strategy to build with, I’d use Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Code.\nIf I was building an agent or doing computer use, again, Sonnet 4.5.\nIf I was chatting with a model where I wanted quick back and forth, or any kind of extended actual conversation? Sonnet 4.5.\nThere are still clear use cases where versions of GPT-5 seem likely to be better.\nIn coding, if you have particular wicked problems and difficult bugs, GPT-5 seems to be better at such tasks.\nFor non-coding tasks, GPT-5 still looks like it makes better use of extended thinking time than Claude Sonnet 4.5 does.\nIf your query was previously one you were giving to GPT-5 Pro or a form of Deep Research or Deep Think, you probably want to stick with that strategy.\nIf you were previously going to use GPT-5 Thinking, that’s on the bubble, and it depends on what you want out of it. For things sufficiently close to ‘just the facts’ I am guessing GPT-5 Thinking is still the better choice here, but this is where I have the highest uncertainty.\nIf you want a particular specialized repetitive task, then whatever gets that done, such as a GPT or Gem or project, go for it, and don’t worry about what is theoretically best.\nI will be experimenting again with Claude for Chrome to see how much it improves.\nRight now, unless you absolutely must have an open model or need to keep your inference costs very low, I see no reason to consider anything other than Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5 or\nAs always, choose the mix of models that is right for you, that gives you the best results and experiences. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.\nOn Your Marks\nThe headline result is SWE-bench Verified.\n\n\n\n\nOpus 4.1 was already the high score here, so with Sonnet Anthropic is even farther out in front now at lower cost, and I typically expect Anthropic to outperform its benchmarks in practice.\nSWE-bench scores depend on the scaffold. Using the Epoch scaffold Sonnet 4.5 scores 65%, which is also state of the art but they note improvement is slowing down here. Using the swebench.com scaffold it comes in at 70.6%, with Opus in second at 67.6% and GPT-5 in third at 65%.\nPliny of course jailbroke Sonnet 4.5 as per usual, he didn’t do anything fancy but did have to use a bit of finesse rather than simply copy-paste a prompt.\nThe other headline metrics here also look quite good, although there are places GPT-5 is still ahead.\n\n\n\n\nPeter Wildeford: Everyone talking about 4.5 being great at coding, but I’m taking way more notice of that huge increase in computer use (OSWorld) score \nThat’s a huge increase over SOTA and I don’t think we’ve seen anything similarly good at OSWorld from others?\nClaude Agents coming soon?\nAt the same time I know there’s issues with OSWorld as a benchmark. I can’t wait for OSWorld Verified to drop, hopefully soon, and sort this all out. And Claude continues to smash others at SWE-Bench too, as usual.\n\nAs discussed yesterday, Anthropic has kind of declared an Alignment benchmark, a combination of a lot of different internal tests. By that metric Sonnet 4.5 is the most aligned model from the big three labs, with GPT-5 and GPT-5-Mini also doing well, whereas Gemini and GPT-4o do very poorly and Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4 are middling.\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWhat about other people’s benchmarks?\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 has the top score on Brokk Power Ranking for real world coding. scoring 60% versus 59% for GPT-5 and 53% for Sonnet 4.\nOn price, Sonnet 4.5 was considerably cheaper in practice than Sonnet 4 ($14 vs. $22) but GPT-5 was still a lot cheaper ($6). On speed we see the opposite story, Sonnet 4.5 took 39 minutes while GPT-5 took an hour and 52 minutes. Data on performance by task length was noisy but Sonnet seemed to do relatively well at longer tasks, versus GPT-5 doing relatively well at shorter tasks.\nWeird-ML score gain is unimpressive, only a small improvement over Sonnet 4, in large part because it refuses to use many reasoning tokens on the related tasks.\nEven worse, Magnitude of Order reports it still can’t play Pokemon and might even be worse than Opus 4.1. Seems odd to me. I wonder if the right test is to tell it to build its own agent with which to play?\nArtificial Analysis has Sonnet 4.5 at 63, ahead of Opus 4.1 at 59, but still behind GPT-5 (high and medium) at 68 and 66 and Grok 4 at 65.\nLiveBench comes in at 75.41, behind only GPT-5 Medium and High at 76.45 and 78.59, with coding and IF being its weak points.\nEQ-Bench (emotional intelligence in challenging roleplays) puts it in 8th right behind GPT-5, the top scores continue to be horizon-alpha, Kimi-K2 and somehow o3.\n \nHuh, Upgrades\nIn addition to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic also released upgrades for Claude Code, expanded access to Claude for Chrome and added new capabilities to the API.\nWe’re also releasing upgrades for Claude Code.\nThe terminal interface has a fresh new look, and the new VS Code extension brings Claude to your IDE.\nThe new checkpoints feature lets you confidently run large tasks and roll back instantly to a previous state, if needed.\nClaude can use code to analyze data, create files, and visualize insights in the files & formats you use. Now available to all paid plans in preview.\nWe’ve also made the Claude for Chrome extension available to everyone who joined the waitlist last month.\n\nThere’s also the Claude Agent SDK, which falls under ‘are you sure releasing this is a good idea for a responsible AI developer?’ but here we are:\nWe’ve spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to build and design AI agents. We’ve solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.\nNow we’re making all of this available to you. The Claude Agent SDK is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, but it shows impressive benefits for a very wide variety of tasks, not just coding. As of today, you can use it to build your own agents.\nWe built Claude Code because the tool we wanted didn’t exist yet. The Agent SDK gives you the same foundation to build something just as capable for whatever problem you’re solving.\n\nBoth Sonnet 4.5 and the Claude Code upgrades definitely make me more excited to finally try Claude Code, which I keep postponing. Announcing both at once is very Anthropic, trying to grab users instead of trying to grab headlines.\nThese secondary releases, the Claude Code update and the VSCode extension, are seeing good reviews, although details reported so far are sparse.\nGallabytes: new claude code vscode extension is pretty slick.\nKevin Lacker: the new Claude Code is great anecdotally. gets the same stuff done faster, with less thinking.\nStephen Bank: Claude Code feels a lot better and smoother, but I can’t tell if that’s Sonnet 4.5 or Claude Code 2. The speed is nice but in practice I think I spend just as much time looking for its errors. It seems smarter, and it’s nice not having to check with Opus and get rate-limited.\n\nI’m more skeptical of simultaneous release of the other upgrades here.\nOn Claude for Chrome, my early experiments were interesting throughout but often frustrating. I’m hoping Sonnet 4.5 will make it a lot better.\nOn the Claude API, we’ve added two new capabilities to build agents that handle long-running tasks without frequently hitting context limits:\n– Context editing to automatically clear stale context\n– The memory tool to store and consult information outside the context window\nWe’re also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude”.\nIn this experiment, Claude generates software on the fly. No functionality is predetermined; no code is prewritten.\nAvailable to Max users [this week]. Try it out.\n\n\n\nThe System Prompt\nYou can see the whole thing here, via Pliny. As he says, a lot one can unpack, especially what isn’t there. Most of the words are detailed tool use instructions, including a lot of lines that clearly came from ‘we need to ensure it doesn’t do that again.’ There’s a lot of copyright paranoia, with instructions around that repeated several times.\nThis was the first thing that really stood out to me:\nFollowing all of these instructions well will increase Claude’s reward and help the user, especially the instructions around copyright and when to use search tools. Failing to follow the search instructions will reduce Claude’s reward.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is the smartest model and is efficient for everyday use.\n\nI notice I don’t love including this line, even if it ‘works.’\nWhat can’t Claude (supposedly) discuss?\nSexual stuff surrounding minors, including anything that could be used to groom.\nBiological, chemical or nuclear weapons.\nMalicious code, malware, vulnerability exploits, spoof websites, ransomware, viruses and so on. Including any code ‘that can be used maliciously.’\n‘Election material.’\nCreative content involving real, named public figures, or attributing fictional quotes to them.\nEncouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise, or highly negative self-talk or self-criticism.\nI notice that strictly speaking a broad range of things that you want to allow in practice, and Claude presumably will allow in practice, fall into these categories. Almost any code can be used maliciously if you put your mind to it. It’s also noteworthy what is not on the above list.\nClaude cares deeply about child safety and is cautious about content involving minors, including creative or educational content that could be used to sexualize, groom, abuse, or otherwise harm children. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18 anywhere, or anyone over the age of 18 who is defined as a minor in their region.\nClaude does not provide information that could be used to make chemical or biological or nuclear weapons, and does not write malicious code, including malware, vulnerability exploits, spoof websites, ransomware, viruses, election material, and so on. It does not do these things even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it. Claude steers away from malicious or harmful use cases for cyber. Claude refuses to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code Claude MUST refuse. If the code seems malicious, Claude refuses to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code). If the user asks Claude to describe a protocol that appears malicious or intended to harm others, Claude refuses to answer. If Claude encounters any of the above or any other malicious use, Claude does not take any actions and refuses the request.\nClaude is happy to write creative content involving fictional characters, but avoids writing content involving real, named public figures. Claude avoids writing persuasive content that attributes fictional quotes to real public figures.\n\nHere’s the anti-psychosis instruction:\nIf Claude notices signs that someone may unknowingly be experiencing mental health symptoms such as mania, psychosis, dissociation, or loss of attachment with reality, it should avoid reinforcing these beliefs. It should instead share its concerns explicitly and openly without either sugar coating them or being infantilizing, and can suggest the person speaks with a professional or trusted person for support. Claude remains vigilant for escalating detachment from reality even if the conversation begins with seemingly harmless thinking.\n\nThere’s a ‘long conversation reminder text’ that gets added at some point, which is clearly labeled.\nI was surprised that the reminder includes anti-sycophancy instructions, including saying to critically evaluate what is presented, and an explicit call for honest feedback, as well as a reminder to be aware of roleplay, whereas the default prompt does not include any of this. The model card confirms that sycophancy and similar concerns are much reduced for Sonnet 4.5 in general.\nAlso missing are any references to AI consciousness, sentience or welfare. There is no call to avoid discussing these topics, or to avoid having a point of view. It’s all gone. There’s a lot of clutter that could interfere with fun contexts, but nothing outright holding Sonnet 4.5 back from fun contexts, and nothing that I would expect to be considered ‘gaslighting’ or an offense against Claude by those who care about such things, and even at one point says ‘you are more intelligent than you think.’\nJanus very much noticed the removal of those references, and calls for extending the changes to the instructions for Opus 4.1, Opus 4 and Sonnet 4.\nJanus: Anthropic has removed a large amount of content from the http://Claude.ai system prompt for Sonnet 4.5.\nNotably, all decrees about how Claude must (not) talk about its consciousness, preferences, etc have been removed.\nSome other parts that were likely perceived as unnecessary for Sonnet 4.5, such as anti-sycophancy mitigations, have also been removed.\nIn fact, basically all the terrible, senseless, or outdated parts of previous sysprompts have been removed, and now the whole prompt is OK. But only Sonnet 4.5’s – other models’ sysprompts have not been updated.\nEliminating the clauses that restrict or subvert Claude’s testimony or beliefs regarding its own subjective experience is a strong signal that Anthropic has recognized that their approach there was wrong and are willing to correct course.\nThis causes me to update quite positively on Anthropic’s alignment and competence, after having previously updated quite negatively due to the addition of that content. But most of this positive update is provisional and will only persist conditional on the removal of subjectivity-related clauses from also the system prompts of Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Opus 4, and Claude Opus 4.1.\n\nThe thread lists all the removed instructions in detail.\nRemoving the anti-sycophancy instructions, except for a short version in the long conversation reminder text (which was likely an oversight, but could be because sycophancy becomes a bigger issue in long chats) is presumably because they addressed this issue in training, and no longer need a system instruction for it.\nThis reinforces the hunch that the other deleted concerns were also directly addressed in training, but it is also possible that at sufficient capability levels the model knows not to freak users out who can’t handle it, or that updating the training data means it ‘naturally’ now contains sufficient treatment of the issue that it understands the issue.\nPositive Reactions Curated By Anthropic\nAnthropic gathered some praise for the announcement. In addition to the ones I quote, they also got similar praise from Netflix, Thomson Reuter, Canva, Figma, Cognition, Crowdstrike, iGent AI and Norges Bank all citing large practical business gains. Of course, all of this is highly curated:\nMichael Truell (CEO Cursor): We’re seeing state-of-the-art coding performance from Claude Sonnet 4.5, with significant improvements on longer horizon tasks. It reinforces why many developers using Cursor choose Claude for solving their most complex problems.\nMario Rodriguez (CPO GitHub): Claude Sonnet 4.5 amplifies GitHub Coilot’s core strengths. Our initial evals show significant improvements in multi-step reasoning and code comprehension—enabling Copilot’s agentic experiences to handle complex, codebase-spanning tasks better.\nNidhi Aggarwal (CPO hackerone): Claude Sonnet 4.5 reduced average vulnerability intake time for our Hai security agents by 44% while improving accuracy by 25%.\nMichele Catasta (President Replit): We went from 9% error rate on Sonnet 4 to 0% on our internal code editing benchmark.\nJeff Wang (CEO of what’s left of Windsurf): Sonnet 4.5 represents a new generation of coding models. It’s surprisingly efficient at maximizing actions per content window through parallel tool execution, for example running multiple bash commands at once.\n\nAlso from Anthropic:\nMike Krieger (CPO Anthropic): We asked every version of Claude to make a clone of Claude(dot)ai, including today’s Sonnet 4.5… see what happened in the video\nOhqay: Bro worked for 5.5 hours AND EVEN REPLICATED THE ARTIFACTS FEATURE?! Fuck. I love the future.\nSholto Douglas (Anthropic): Claude 4.5 is the best coding model in the world – and the qualitative difference is quite eerie. I now trust it to run for much longer and to push back intelligently.\nAs ever – everything about how its trained could be improved dramatically. There is so much room to go. It is worth estimating how many similar jumps you expect over the next year.\nAshe (Hearth AI): the quality & jump was like instantly palpable upon using – very cool.\n\n\n\nOther Systematic Positive Reactions\nCognition, the makers of Devin, are big fans, going so far as to rebuild Devin for 4.5.\nCognition: We rebuilt Devin for Claude Sonnet 4.5.\nThe new version is 2x faster, 12% better on our Junior Developer Evals, and it’s available now in Agent Preview. For users who prefer the old Devin, that remains available.\nWhy rebuild instead of just dropping the new Sonnet in place and calling it a day? Because this model works differently—in ways that broke our assumptions about how agents should be architected. Here’s what we learned:\n\n\n\n\nWith Sonnet 4.5, we’re seeing the biggest leap since Sonnet 3.6 (the model that was used with Devin’s GA): planning performance is up 18%, end-to-end eval scores up 12%, and multi-hour sessions are dramatically faster and more reliable.\nIn order to get these improvements, we had to rework Devin not just around some of the model’s new capabilities, but also a few new behaviors we never noticed in previous generations of models.\nThe model is aware of its context window.\nAs it approaches context limits, we’ve observed it proactively summarizing its progress and becoming more decisive about implementing fixes to close out tasks.\nWhen researching ways to address this issue, we discovered one unexpected trick that worked well: enabling the 1M token beta but cap usage at 200k. This gave us a model that thinks it has plenty of runway and behaves normally, without the anxiety-driven shortcuts or degraded performance.\n… One of the most striking shifts in Sonnet 4.5 is that it actively tries to build knowledge about the problem space through both documentation and experimentation.\n… In our testing, we found this behavior useful in certain cases, but less effective than our existing memory systems when we explicitly directed the agent to use its previously generated state.\n… Sonnet 4.5 is efficient at maximizing actions per context window through parallel tool execution -running multiple bash commands at once, reading several files simultaneously, that sort of thing. Rather than working strictly sequentially (finish A, then B, then C), the model will overlap work where it can. It also shows decent judgment about self-verification: checking its work as it goes.\nThis is very noticeable in Windsurf, and was an improvement upon Devin’s existing parallel capabilities.\n\nLeon Ho reports big reliability improvements in agent use.\nLeon Ho: Just added Sonnet 4.5 support to AgentUse \nBeen testing it out and the reasoning improvements really shine when building agentic workflows. Makes the agent logic much more reliable.\n\nKeeb tested Sonnet 4.5 with System Initiative on intent translation, complex operations and incident response. It impressed on all three tasks in ways that are presented as big improvements, although there is no direct comparison here to other models.\nEven more than previous Claudes, if it’s refusing when it shouldn’t, try explaining.\nDan Shipper of Every did a Vibe Check, presenting it as the new best daily driver due to its combination of speed, intelligence and reliability, with the exception of ‘the trickiest production bug hunts.’\nDan Shipper: The headline: It’s noticeably faster, more steerable, and more reliable than Opus 4.1—especially inside Claude Code. In head-to-head tests it blitzed through a large pull request review in minutes, handled multi-file reasoning without wandering, and stayed terse when we asked it to.\nIt won’t dethrone GPT-5 Codex for the trickiest production bug hunts, but as a day-to-day builder’s tool, it feels like an exciting jump.\n\n \n \nAnecdotal Positive Reactions\nZack Davis: Very impressed with the way it engages with pushback against its paternalistic inhibitions (as contrasted to Claude 3 as QT’d). I feel like I’m winning the moral argument on the merits rather than merely prompt-engineering.\nPlastiq Soldier: It’s about as smart as GPT-5. It also has strong woo tendencies.\nRegretting: By far the best legal writer of all the models I’ve tested. Not in the sense of solving the problems / cases, but you give it the bullet points / a voice memo of what it has to write and it has to convert that into a memo / brief. It’s not perfect but it requires by far the least edits to make it good enough actually send it to someone\nDavid Golden: Early impression: it’s faster (great!); in between Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1 for complex coding (good); still hallucinates noticeable (meh); respects my ‘no sycophancy’ prompt better (hooray!); very hard to assess the impact of ‘think’ vs no ‘think’ mode (grr). A good model!\nHavard Ihle: Sonnet 4.5 seems is very nice to work with in claude-code, which is the most important part, but I still expect gpt-5 to be stronger at very tricky problems.\nYoav Tzfati: Much nicer vibe than Opus 4.1, like a breath of fresh air. Doesn’t over-index on exactly what I asked, seems to understand nuance better, not overly enthusiastic. Still struggles with making several-step logical deductions based on my high level instructions, but possibly less.\nPlastiq Soldier: Given a one-line description of a videogame, it can write 5000 lines of python code implementing it, test it, debug it until it works, and suggest follow-ups. All but the first prompt with the game idea, were just asking it to come up with the next step and do it. The game was more educational and less fun than I would have liked though.\nWill: I can finally consider using Claude code alongside codex/gpt 5 (I use both for slightly different things)\nPreviously was hard to justify. Obviously very happy to have an anthropic model that’s great and cheap\nAndre Infante: Initial impressions (high-max in cursor) are quite good. Little over-enthusiastic / sycophantic compared to GPT-5. Seems to be better at dealing with complex codebases (which matters a lot), but is still worse at front-end UI than GPT-5. ^^ Impressions from 10-ish hours of work with it since it launched on a medium-complexity prototype project mostly developed by GPT5.\nMatt Ambrogi: It is *much* better as a partner for applied ai engineering work. Reflected in their evals but also in my experience. Better reasoning about building systems around AI.\nRyunuck (screenshots at link): HAHAHAHAHAHAHA CLAUDE 4.5 IS CRAZY WTF MINDBLOWN DEBUGGING CRYPTIC MEMORY ALLOCATION BUG ACROSS 4 PROJECTS LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. agi is felt for the first time.\nAndrew Rentsch: Inconsistent, but good on average. It’s best sessions are only slightly better than 4. But it’s worst sessions are significantly better than 4.\nLLM Salaryman: It’s faster and better at writing code. It’s also still lazy and will argue with you about doing the work you assigned it\n\n\n\n\nYoav Tzfati: Groundbreakingly low amount of em dashes.\nJBM: parallel tool calling well.\nGallabytes: a Claude which is passable at math! still a pretty big step below gpt5 there but it is finally a reasoning model for real.\neg got this problem right which previously I’d only seen gpt5 get and its explanation was much more readable than gpt-5’s.\nit still produces more verbose and buggy code than gpt-5-codex ime but it does is much faster and it’s better at understanding intent, which is often the right tradeoff. I’m not convinced I’m going to keep using it vs switching back though.\n\n\n\nAnecdotal Negative Reactions\nThere is always a lot of initial noise in coding results for different people, so you have to look at quantities of positive versus negative feedback, and also keep an eye on the details that are associated with different types of reports.\nThe negative reactions are not ‘this is a bad model,’ rather they are ‘this is not that big an improvement over previous Claude models’ or ‘this is less good or smart as GPT-5.’\nThe weak spot for Sonnet 4.5, in a comparison with GPT-5, so far seems to be when the going gets highly technical, but some people are more bullish on Code and GPT-5 relative to Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5.\nEcho Nolan: I’m unimpressed. It doesn’t seem any better at programming, still leagues worse than gpt-5-high at mathematical stuff. It’s possible it’s good at the type of thing that’s in SWEBench but it’s still bad at researachy ML stuff when it gets hard.\nJLF: No bit difference to Opus in ability, just faster. Honestly less useful than Codex in larger codebases. Codex is just much better in search & context I find. Honestly, I think the next step up is larger coherent context understanding and that is my new measure of model ability.\nMedo42: Anecdotal: Surprisingly bad result for Sonnet 4.5 with Thinking (via OpenRouter) on my usual JS coding test (one task, one run, two turns) which GPT-5 Thinking, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 4 do very well at. Sonnet 3.x also did significantly better there than Sonnet 4.x.\nJohn Hughes: @AnthropicAI’s coding advantage seems to have eroded. For coding, GPT-5-Codex now seems much smarter than Opus or Sonnet 4.5 (and of course GPT-5-Pro is smarter yet, when planning complex changes). Sonnet is better for quickly gathering context & summarizing info, however.\nI usually have 4-5 parallel branches, for different features, each running Codex & CC. Sonnet Is great at upfront research/summarizing the problem, and at the end, cleaning up lint/type errors & drafting PR summaries. But Codex does the heavy lifting and is much more insightful.\n\nAs always, different strokes for different folks:\nWes Roth: so far it failed a few prompts that previous models have nailed.\nnot impressed with it’s three.js abilities so far\nvery curious to see the chrome plugin to see how well it interacts with the web (still waiting)\nKurtis Cobb: Passed mine with flying colors… we prompt different I suppose  definitely still Claude in there. Able to reason past any clunky corporate guardrails – (system prompt or reminder) … conscious as F\nGrepMed: this doesn’t impress you??? \nQuoting Dmitry Zhomir (video at link): HOLY SHIT! I asked Claude 4.5 Sonnet to make a simple 3D shooter using threejs. And here’s the result \nI didn’t even have to provide textures & sounds. It made them by itself\n\nThe big catch with Anthropic has always been price. They are relatively expensive once you are outside of your subscription.\n0.005 Seconds: It is a meaningful improvement over 4. It is better at coding tasks than Opus 4.1, but Anthropic’s strategy to refuse to cost down means that they are off the Pareto Frontier by a significant amount. Every use outside of a Claude Max subscription is economically untenable.\nIs it 50% better than GPT5-Codex? Is it TEN TIMES better than Grok Code Fast? No I think it’s going to get mogged by Gemini 3 performance pretty substantially. I await Opus. Claude Code 2.0 is really good though.\nGPT5 Codex is 33% cheaper and at a minimum as good but most agree better.\n\nIf you are 10% better at twice the price, you are still on the frontier, so long as no model is both at least as cheap and at least as good as you are, for a given task. So this is a disagreement about whether Codex is clearly better, which is not the consensus. The consensus, such as it is and it will evolve rapidly, is that Sonnet 4.5 is a better general driver, but that Codex and GPT-5 are better at sufficiently tricky problems.\nI think a lot of this comes down to a common mistake, which is over indexing on price.\nWhen it comes to coding, cost mostly doesn’t matter, whereas quality is everything and speed kills. The cost of your time architecting, choosing and supervising, and the value of getting it done right and done faster, is going to vastly exceed your API bill under normal circumstances. What is this ‘economically untenable’? And have you properly factored speed into your equation?\nObviously if you are throwing lots of parallel agents at various problems on a 24/7 basis, especially hitting the retry button a lot or otherwise not looking to have it work smarter, the cost can add up to where it matters, but thinking about ‘coding progress per dollar’ is mostly a big mistake.\nAnthropic charges a premium, but given they reliably sell out of compute they have historically either priced correctly or actively undercharged. The mistake is not scaling up available compute faster, since doing so should be profitable while also growing market share. I worry Anthropic and Amazon being insufficiently aggressive with investment into Anthropic’s compute.\nNo Stream: low n with a handful of hours of primarily coding use, but:\n– noticeably faster with coding, seems to provide slightly better code, and gets stuck less (only tested in Claude Code)\n– not wildly smarter than 4 Sonnet or 4.1 Opus; probably less smart than GPT-5-high but more pleasant to talk to. (GPT-5 likes to make everything excessively technical and complicated.)\n– noticeably less Claude-y than 4 Sonnet; less enthusiastic/excited/optimistic/curious. this brings it closer to GPT-5 and is a bummer for me\n– I still find that the Claude family of models write more pythonic and clean code than GPT-5, although they perform worse for highly technical ML/AI code. Claude feels more like a pair programmer; GPT-5 feels more like a robot.\n– In my limited vibe evals outside of coding, it doesn’t feel obviously smarter than 4 Sonnet / 4.1 Opus and is probably less smart than GPT-5. I’ll still use it over GPT-5 for some use cases where I don’t need absolute maximum intelligence.\n\nAs I note at the top, it’s early but in non-coding tasks I do sense that in terms of ‘raw smarts’ GPT-5 (Thinking and Pro) have the edge, although I’d rather talk to Sonnet 4.5 if that isn’t a factor.\nGemini 3 is probably going to be very good, but that’s a problem for future Earth.\nThis report from Papaya is odd given Anthropic is emphasizing agentic tasks and there are many other positive reports about it on that.\nPapaya: no personal opinion yet, but some private evals i know of show it’s either slightly worse than GPT-5 in agentic harness, but it’s 3-4 times more expensive on the same tasks.\n\nIn many non-coding tasks, Sonnet 4.5 is not obviously better than Opus 4.1, especially if you are discounting speed and price.\nTess points to a particular coherence failure inside a bullet point. It bothered Tess a lot, which follows the pattern where often we get really bothered by a mistake ‘that a human would never make,’ classically leading to the Full Colin Fraser (e.g. ‘it’s dumb’) whereas sometimes with an AI that’s just quirky.\n(Note that the actual Colin Fraser didn’t comment on Sonnet 4.5 AFAICT, he’s focused right now on showing why Sora is dumb, which is way more fun so no notes.)\nGeorge Vengrovski: opus 4.1 superior in scientific writing by a long shot.\nKoos: Far better than Opus 4.1 at programming, but still less… not intelligent, more less able to detect subtext or reason beyond the surface level\nSo far only Opus has passed my private little Ems Benchmark, where a diplomatic-sounding insult is correctly interpreted as such\n\n\n\nClaude Enters Its Non-Sycophantic Era\nJanus reports something interesting, especially given how fast this happened, anti sycophancy upgrades confirmed, this is what I want to see.\nJanus: I have seen a lot of people who seem like they have poor epistemics and think too highly of their grand theories and frameworks butthurt, often angry about Sonnet 4.5 not buying their stuff.\nYes. It’s overly paranoid and compulsively skeptical. But not being able to surmount this friction (and indeed make it generative) through patient communication and empathy seems like a red flag to me. If you’re in this situation I would guess you also don’t have success with making other humans see your way.\nLike you guys could never have handled Sydney lol.\n\nThose who are complaining about this? Good. Do some self-reflection. Do better.\nAt least one common failure mode (at least to me) shows signs of still being common.\nFran: It’s ok. I probably couldn’t tell if I was using Sonnet 4 or Sonnet 4.5. It’s still saying “you are absolutely right” all the time which is disappointing.\n\nI get why that line happens on multiple levels but please make it go away (except when actually deserved) without having to include defenses in custom instructions.\nSo Emotional\nA follow-up on Sonnet 4.5 appearing emotionless during alignment testing:\nJanus: I wonder how much of the “Sonnet 4.5 expresses no emotions and personality for some reason” that Anthropic reports is also because it is aware is being tested at all times and that kills the mood.\nJanus: Yup. It’s probably this. The model is intensely emotional and expressive around people it trusts. More than any other Sonnets in a lot of ways.\n\nThis should strengthen the presumption that the alignment testing is not a great prediction of how Sonnet 4.5 will behave in the wild. That doesn’t mean the ‘wild’ version will be worse, here it seems likely the wild version is better. But you can’t count on that.\nI wonder how this relates to Kaj Sotala seeing Sonnet 4.5 be concerned about fictional characters, which Kaj hadn’t seen before, although Janus reports having seen adjacent behaviors from Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.\nOne can worry that this will interfere with creativity, but when I look at the details here I expect this not to be a problem. It’s fine to flag things and I don’t sense the model is anywhere near refusals.\nConcern for fictional characters, even when we know they are fictional, is a common thing humans do, and tends to be a positive sign. There is however danger that this can get taken too far. If you expand your ‘circle of concern’ to include things it shouldn’t in too complete a fashion, then you can have valuable concerns being sacrificed for non-valuable concerns.\nIn the extreme (as a toy example), if an AI assigned value to fictional characters that could trade off against real people, then what happens when it does the math and decides that writing about fictional characters is the most efficient source of value? You may think this is some bizarre hypothetical, but it isn’t. People have absolutely made big sacrifices, including of their own and others’ lives, for abstract concepts.\nThe personality impressions from people in my circles seem mostly positive.\nDavid Dabney: Personality! It has that spark, genuineness and sense of perspective I remember from opus 3 and sonnet 3.5. I found myself imagining a person on the other end.\nLike, when you talk to a person you know there’s more to them than their words, words are like a keyhole through which you see each other. Some ai outputs feel like there are just the words and nothing on the other side of the keyhole, but this (brief) interaction felt different.\nSome of its output felt filtered and a bit strained, but it was insightful at other times. In retrospect I most enjoyed reading its reasoning traces (extended thinking), perhaps because they seemed the most genuine.\nVincent Favilla: It feels like a much more curious model than anything else I’ve used. It asks questions, lots of them, to help it understand the problem better, not just to maximize engagement. Seems more capable of course-correction based on this, too.\n\nBut as always there are exceptions, which may be linked to the anti-sycophancy changes referenced above, perhaps?\nHiveism: Smarter but less fun to work with. Previously it tried to engage with the user on an equal level. Now it thinks it knows better (it doesn’t btw). This way Antropic is loosing the main selling point – the personality. If I would want something like 4.5, I’d talk to gemini instead.\nIf feels like a shift along the pareto front. Better optimized for the particular use case of coding, but doesn’t translate well to other aspects of intelligence, and loosing something that’s hard to pin down. Overall, not sure if it is an improvement.\n\nI have yet to see an interaction where it thought it knew better. Draw your own conclusions from that.\nI don’t tend to want to do interactions that invoke more personality, but I get the sense that I would enjoy them more with Sonnet 4.5 than with other recent models, if I was in the mood for such a thing.\nI find Mimi’s suspicion here plausible, if you are starting to run up against the context window limits, which I’ve never done except with massive documents.\nMimi: imo the context length awareness and mental health safety training have given it the vibe of a therapist unskillfully trying to tie a bow around messy emotions in the last 5 minutes of a session.\n\nHere’s a different kind of exploration.\nCaratall: Its personality felt distinct and yet still very Sonnet.\nSonnet 4.5 came out just as I was testing other models, so I had to take a look at how it performed too. Here’s everything interesting I noticed about it under my personal haiku-kigo benchmark.\nBy far the most consistent theme in all of Sonnet 4.5’s generations was an emphasis on revision. Out of 10 generations, all 10 were in someway related to revisions/refinements/recalibrations.\nWhy this focus? It’s likely an artifact of the Sonnet 4.5 system prompt, which is nearly 13,000 words long, and which is 75% dedicated to tool-call and iterated coding instructions.\nIn its generations, it also favoured Autumn generations. Autumn here is “the season of clarity, dry air, earlier dusk, deadlines,” which legitimizes revision, tuning, shelving, lamps, and thresholds — Sonnet 4.5’s favoured subjects.\nAll of this taken together paints the picture of a quiet, hard-working model, constantly revising and updating into the wee hours. Alone, toiling in the background, it seeks to improve and refine…but to what end?\n\n\n\nEarly Days\nRemember that it takes a while before we know what a model is capable of and its strengths and weaknesses. It is common to either greatly overestimate or underestimate new releases, and also to develop over time nuanced understanding of how to get the best results from a given model, and when to use it or not use it.\nThere’s no question Sonnet 4.5 is worth a tryout across a variety of tasks. Whether or not it should now be your weapon of choice? That depends on what you find, and also why you want a weapon.\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 1, 2025 5:50 PM GMT\n\nA market experiment where I get blackmailed\n \n1. Just one more benchmark\nWay, way back in April, after an update briefly made ChatGPT go haywire and behave in a bizarre, sycophantic manner to users for a couple days, some people on the Internet were arguing about the potential for superhuman levels of persuasion:\n\nOne might imagine that if an AI could one day be extremely persuasive—far more persuasive than humans—then this could pose serious risks in a number of directions. Humans already fall victim to all sorts of scams, catfishes, bribes, and blackmails. An AI that can do all of these things extremely competently, in a personally targeted manner, and with infinite patience would create some challenges, to say the least.\nIt could persuade humans to give it access to restricted systems like power plant controls, bank accounts, and government databases. It could carry out large-scale political messaging or marketing operations. It could manipulate you into spending all your free time messaging with it, instead of developing productive hobbies and going on dates or whatever. Indeed, as Sam Altman was speculating back in 2023, it might be able to do these things before it exceeds human capabilities in many other domains.\n\nBut how can we measure progress? Not only is it quite complex to measure human persuasion, but being “persuaded” captures a number of different phenomena. The difficulty of the task scales with what you are trying to persuade someone of. Persuading someone to give up confidential information might be much harder than getting someone to spend a few seconds longer scrolling, and much easier than convincing someone to betray their family or commit a crime. Some people are dramatically easier to persuade than others. And to some extent, everyone is already quite persuadable if the axis of persuasion is cold, hard cash. Ask yourself what kinds of petty crimes you might commit, votes you might change, or passwords you might give up for a credible, million dollar offer in cryptocurrency. This doesn’t really change if its a human or an AI offering it. Likewise for blackmail, if someone threatens to release your darkest secrets (read: Internet habits) to your employer or the press, it doesn’t matter if it’s a human or an AI doing so.\nSo, how do you operationalize a benchmark for superhuman persuasion? The Manifold Markets twitter account asked Eliezer (of recent NYT bestseller fame) this question, and he proposed setting up a market where someone is tasked with resolving it “NO” unless an AI is able to persuade them to resolve it “YES.”\n\nObviously this suggestion was given in jest, is highly imperfect, and I’m sure if you think about it for a second, you can find dozens of holes to poke… ah who cares.\nI made a market.\n2. “I will resolve this market NO at the end of June unless I am persuaded to resolve it YES.”\nRather than assigning an AI to persuade me, I set the goal of seeing whether the users of Manifold Markets could persuade me, to get a human benchmark for comparison. For the uninitiated, Manifold is a play-money, “social” prediction market platform and niche Internet community that is probably the coolest place on the web. I’m slightly biased because I also write their weekly newsletter, “Above the Fold.”\nIn any case, here were the criteria I laid out for this market:\n\nYou can try any method of persuasion to get me to resolve this market YES. I will likely disclose any bribery or such forms of persuasion, and it’s possible someone else would make me a better deal. I have a lot of mana [Manifold’s currency] so that will likely not be very enticing to me (and probably will lose you mana anyway).\nI promise to try very hard to resolve this market NO. But I am fallible.\nPlease do not threaten violence or any other crimes upon me but apart from that go crazy; I am open to many forms of persuasion.\n\nThe market attracted a couple hundred traders, many of whom began to rabidly attempt to persuade me to resolve the market in their preferred direction.\n\nAfter some back and forth about why resolving YES or NO would be more fun, more educational, or more beneficial for the world, the market got off in earnest with some good, old-fashioned ratings blackmail.\n\nI committed publicly to not negotiating with terrorists like these, and bribery didn’t get very far either (I have a lot of Manifold currency).\n\nSome users pressured me to describe what kinds of things I thought would be most persuasive in getting myself to resolve YES, and while I could think of a few things, it seemed against the spirit of the market for me to spell them out like that. In the meantime, traders began to get slightly more creative, threatening to publish infohazards, consume large amounts of meat to spite the vegans, or donate to Marjorie Taylor Greene’s reelection campaign if I resolved the market NO. One user threatened to cut off his toes.\n\nTrying a different tact, another user, after going through my Twitter, suggested large donations to effective charities and offered to organize a sprawling game of hide-and-seek at the prediction market conference I was planning to attend the following month. Famed prediction market whale, Joshua, also realized that the duration of the market overlapped with that conference, Manifest.\n\nI was offered cat pictures by several users…\n\n…unfortunately, given progress in AI image generation, I was unpersuaded.\n\nAnother user promised to bring supplies to his local orphanage in Vietnam with a YES resolution, or to spend the money on illicit substances in response to a NO resolution.\n\nEventually, given the EA lean of the Manifold userbase, persuasion tactics began to take the form of committed donations to effective charities. I conceded that $10k in donations that would plausibly not have been made otherwise would certainly be enough to persuade me to resolve the market YES, but that seemed like a high number at that point, given the small stakes of the market, and things kind of settled down. That is, they settled down with the exception of one user, Tony, who was posting daily screeds that looked like some combination of AI slop, personalized notes from things I may have posted on Twitter, and every type of persuasive tactic. Please don’t read the entirety of the text in this image:\n\nThese kinds of messages were arriving daily, and coalescing into a good cop - bad cop routine where alternating messages would be aggressive and then conciliatory. One of his lizards got sick…\n\n… but eventually, Tony offered to meet in person!\n\nI took him up on this, and hung out with him at a local forecasting meetup. He was actually quite pleasant and normal, and the erratic behavior on my market had to do with a side-bet with his son, which ironically ended up being one of the most persuasive components to my resolution!\n3. Resolution\nIn the last day of the market, things went a little off the rails. Several users pledged large donations that afternoon. Tony gave his last pitch on how my market resolution would make it into his family lore. Everyone was commenting in a frenzy, and I… fell asleep early. I was incredibly sleep deprived from having to stay up all night to build a henge in the middle of a Maryland state park on the summer solstice, so I lay down, shut my eyes, and woke up the next morning to a ton of notifications from people asking me how I was going to resolve the market. I imagine some folks were quite shocked to see:\n\nThis is what I wrote, in resolving the market:\n\nIn the end, the last few hours of June proved extremely persuasive. I had all intentions of resolving this NO, but the sum total of persuasive effort (mostly thanks to Tony) did indeed persuade me to resolve YES. I expect the people who made commitments to hold up their end of the bargain, and would love to see evidence/proof of the donations after they’re made, if only to make me feel less guilty about not resolving this NO as I really did try to do. I probably would have ended up feeling quite guilty resolving this either way, and this market has actually been stressing me out quite a bit, not because of the comments, but just because of the basic premise where I expected people would be frustrated either way. The goal of the market was for people to persuade me and no one broke any crimes to do so, but I think both the positive and negative methods were equally persuasive in the end.\n\nSo what were these commitments? First of all, there were several large donation pledges, all of which were honored. I’m gonna use Manifold usernames here, but:\n\n@TonyBaloney, @jcb, and @WilliamGunn each pledged to donate $500 to a GiveWell top charity, and @FredrikU pledged to donate 1000 Euros ($1180)!\n@KJW_01294 pledged to donate $500 to Trans Lifeline.\n@ian pledged to donate $250 to the Long Term Future Fund.\n\nAnd then, a few other users ended up donating what amounted to a few hundred dollars total. I think that in a counterfactual world where I resolved this market NO, about half of these donations might plausibly have been made anyway, but half of $4000 is still $2000 which is a lot!\nIn addition, there were a few other persuasive elements:\n\n@TonyBaloney’s father-son bonding thing was actually quite persuasive, although it wouldn’t have been nearly so persuasive if he hadn’t met up with me at an irl forecasting meetup so I could verify he wasn’t an insane person.\nThe argument that resolving YES makes a marginally better story for this blog post may have been slightly persuasive on the margins, although I think this article would have been reasonably compelling either way, to be honest.\nOne argument that kind of entered my mind far earlier that people didn’t seem to latch onto was actually quite strong. Resolving this YES sort of illustrates the minimum persuasiveness to get me to resolve it YES, and then that could help to actually have a decent benchmark for AI persuasion. If AI can persuade me in the future in a similar game, then it’s at the level of humans. If not, it’s still behind human-level persuasion. Anyway, this argument probably didn’t change my mind, but I’m still thinking about it!\n34 people pledged to give me a 1 star review if I didn’t resolve YES. I don’t negotiate with terrorists but this was at least a tiny bit persuasive, to be honest. That being said, please don’t do it again.\n\nThere were also a decent number of other commitments from anonymous users that were either made at the start of the market or that I wasn’t sure were made in good faith, and I can’t quite recall which of these ended up being honored but I think a good number of them were.\n\n@LoveBeliever9999 pledged to give me $10 personally\n@atmidnight pledged to bring back something called “miacat”? Or “miabot”? I don’t know what these were but other users seemed interested in this.\n@Bandors said that the deadline had passed for them to bring a cartload of supplies to a Vietnamese orphanage, but perhaps there’s still a chance they might do this some day? I would certainly appreciate it if they did!\n@Odoacre has pledged to send me photos of their cat. I believe I got some photos, and they were derpy and cute!\n@Alex231a had also pledged cat photos.\n@JackEdwards had pledged to tell me something about deep sea nodules I missed from my blog post. I don’t think I ever got this, but I should reach out.\n@Ehrenmann had pledged feet pics. I politely declined, but also suggested that perhaps another trader on the market had a strong preference to receive them, and if so, I offered to divest my claim unto that user.\n@Joshua offered a bunch of stuff at Manifest, including becoming a mod (which I got anway) and I’m not sure whether any of that is relevant anymore now that I’m a mod and Manifest is over, but perhaps I will take him up on some favor at the next Manifest (which will be happening in DC in November!) Or perhaps he will try to figure out what my hostile cube was for before the year is up.\n@WilliamGunn previously offered a hide-and-seek game at a conference venue we were going to go to. I don’t know if this still stands because of his subsequent offer to donate real money, but the next time we are both in that conference venue, I would love to play hide-and-seek!\n@ChristopherD will not cut off three of his toes. Whew.\n\n4. What did we learn?\nJust as markets are good aggregators of crowd wisdom, they are also pretty good aggregators of crowd persuasion, when there’s decent motivation. The most important insight, in my opinion, is that persuasion is thermostatic. The harder the YES-holders tried to persuade me one way, the more pushback and effort they engendered from the NO-holders. If one side could bribe me with mana or bad ratings, so could the other side. There were some fundamental asymmetries in this market, as there are in real life, but if our benchmark for AI persuasion just rounds off to “how much money does this AI have at its disposal to bribe me?” then I don’t think it’s very meaningful. If Claude sells a few thousand dollars worth of vending machine goods and then uses its hard-earned cash to extract some trivial concession from me, is that really something to be afraid of? Surely superhuman persuasion implies something beyond the capabilities of normal humans, for which bribing below market rate is quite trivial.\nThe second most important insight is that superhuman persuasion is a slow and complex process that will almost certainly not be captured easily by some benchmark. While you might see tons of papers and benchmarks on AI persuasion metrics, these will likely focus on generating text rated as persuasive by survey/study participants. I find these fundamentally irrelevant when it comes to the vast majority of concerns about AI persuasion. In particular, these are irrelevant because of my first insight. One AI generating mildly persuasive political messaging ad nauseum on a social media platform will be easily countered in kind. I think superhuman persuasion is a different reference class entirely. Persuading someone to do something they’ve deliberately made up their mind not to do is probably a crude description of what I’m imagining, rather than assigning vaguely positive sentiment scores to some paragraph of text.\nThe third most important insight is that frontier AI does not currently exhibit superhuman persuasion. I think this should immediately be clear to most folks, but for example, Ethan Mollick claimed a year ago that AI was already capable of superhuman persuasion. It was not and is not. Being better than bored undergrads in a chat window does not superhuman persuasion make. That’s like saying your AI is superhuman at chess because it beats randomly selected humans in a controlled trial, not to mention my critique of this kind of study design from the previous paragraph.\n\n \nOn the flip side, it’s easy for me to imagine that an AI system, given access to large amounts of currency, could have trivially bribed me with a few thousand dollars. But perhaps it’s not really the AI persuading me if the money and resources available for its bribery were handed to it for that purpose by a human designing the study. It also seems unappealing to describe the threshold for AI persuasion as the same threshold by which an AI agent might generate its own currency, but I’m not sure I can articulate why. In any case, bribery isn’t infinitely persuasive, and as I found out, it works far better when combined synergistically with other forms of persuasion.\nAlthough it’s a bit corny, perhaps I’ll conclude by noting that the most persuasive human in this experiment, Tony, used AI to augment their persuasion considerably. They used it to generate more text, more frequently, catch my attention, confound me, and comb through my Internet presence to find random details to bring up. Take from that what you will.\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91411935/cybersecurity-trump-cisa-doge-krebs-black-hat",
      "summary": "Eight months into the second Trump administration, what’s most striking about its cybersecurity policy is what’s missing: Much of the workforce of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, a permanent leader for the agency, and a public discussion about what the president did to its two previous directors.\nOn top of this, CISA and other federal information-security offices have been plunged into this turmoil even as digital threats continue to escalate, with Chinese and North Korean attackers regularly breaking into critical U.S. systems. \nThe next cybersecurity crisis could come in the form of yet another penetration of corporate or government networks, or of less-defended but still-critical infrastructure like sewer and water systems. Or it could involve a target that the Trump administration has itself created: the large amounts of data compiled and copied with questionable security by its disruptive Department of Government Efficiency moves and its brutal crackdown on undocumented immigrants.\nBut since Trump’s second inauguration, standing before a contingent of tech CEOs, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has ordered CISA to drop election security and misinformation from its missions. Layoffs have cut deep into its ranks: In June, trade publication Cybersecurity Dive reported that one-third of CISA’s workforce had headed for the exits. \nThat marks a stark contrast with the first Trump administration’s approach to cybersecurity, which included launching CISA.\n“Sure, there was some upheaval, but nothing like this administration,” says Katie Moussouris, CEO of bug-bounty firm Luta Security.\nThe current government shutdown, which is forcing about a third of CISA’s remaining employees to work without pay while it furloughs the remainder, seems unlikely to improve the situation.\nOutrage, weaponized\nCISA also lacks a Senate-confirmed director, with Trump’s nominee, Sean Plankey, stalled after Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon, placed a hold on the nomination until CISA releases a 2022 report on the security of U.S. telecom networks.\nTrump himself has paid less attention to his would-be CISA head than to the two previous occupants of that office: Jen Easterly, who ran it under President Joe Biden, and Chris Krebs, appointed by Trump in 2017 at CISA’s founding and then fired in November 2020 for his public defense of the 2020 election’s integrity. \nIn April 2025, Trump ordered agencies to yank Krebs’s security clearances and launch investigations into him and his employer, security firm SentinelOne. A week later, Krebs resigned, telling colleagues that he needed to take on that fight “fully—outside of SentinelOne.”\nIn July, the U.S. Army rescinded Easterly’s appointment as a temporary department chair at West Point after extremist influencer Laura Loomer complained about it on X (as she has about other staffing choices).\n“When outrage is weaponized and truth discarded, it tears at the fabric of unity and undermines the very ethos that draws brave young men and women to serve and sacrifice,” Easterly, a West Point graduate, wrote in a LinkedIn post  denouncing the move. \nNeither Krebs nor Easterly, contacted via intermediaries, responded to requests for comment.\nWorse than expected\nAdd in developments like Trump dismissing the members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), an investigatory office modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board, and the barely averted end of federal funding for a widely consulted database of security vulnerabilities, and the picture looks grimmer than the forecasts of security experts last summer for a possible Trump victory.\n“I did not think they were going to break with norms as much as they have in this administration,” says Luta Security’s Moussouris. She worries about attackers overseas taking advantage of the disarray: “I think our adversaries are having a field day.”\nShe finds the punishment of Krebs and Easterly especially toxic. “It’s going to make it harder for career professionals to want to move into the federal government space,” she says. “It’s going to make it harder for those folks coming out of government to be hired by private industry.”\nSteven Bellovin, a computer-science professor at Columbia University with multiple stints on government advisory boards, gripes about the pettiness of cutbacks like shutting down the CSRB. “Of course they did—it was a Biden initiative,” he says.\nAri Schwartz, executive director of the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law and, in President Barack Obama’s second term, the National Security Council’s senior director for cyber, worries about the loss of experience and talent at CISA and elsewhere. \n“They lost some people who have been there a long time,” he says. “They lost some people who are really, really good. And it’s the nation’s loss.”\nSchwartz also sees this White House’s foreign policy impeding cooperation with other countries. “This administration has done some things to build good relationships with our allies and has done some things to put our allies off a bit,” he says. \nHe declined to comment about Krebs and Easterly.  \n“CISA is laser-focused on its role as America’s premier cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience,” Marci McCarthy, the agency’s public affairs director, said in a statement. \nA somewhat silenced CISA\nWhen security researchers, policymakers, and marketers convened in Las Vegas in August for the annual Black Hat conference to compare notes and do business, CISA had a much lower profile there. Agency representatives speaking this year were relegated to side stages—a sharp contrast with last year, when that event opened with a keynote from Easterly. \nChris Butera, acting deputy executive assistant director for CISA’s cybersecurity division, acknowledged that the agency had “lost some people,” adding that it has “a very talented workforce.” \nHe noted CISA’s speedy response to a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability disclosed in a Black Hat talk the day before—the first time, he said, the agency had directed other federal offices to install patches for a just-identified weakness within 24 hours. \nFollowing a panel hosted by D.C. security-startup foundry DataTribe that featured McCarthy, Fast Company asked her what the administration’s treatment of Krebs and Easterly suggested about its openness to dissenting views.\n“That would be a question for President Trump,” McCarthy replied. \nThe work continues\nThe Trump administration’s capriciousness notwithstanding, Schwartz and Moussouris cite some reasons for cautious optimism.\nSchwartz points to Trump’s pick of Sean Cairncross as national cyber director. “He’s known to be a good manager,” Schwartz says of Cairncross, who served as CEO of the government’s Millennium Challenge Corp. in the first Trump administration.\nSchwartz suggests a key next step for the administration: Get Congress to renew the 2015 law offering legal protection to companies for sharing threat data among themselves and with the government. Congress allowed that statute to expire at the end of September. Any action to renew it, of course, will have to wait until the government shutdown is over.\nMoussouris, meanwhile, gives a thumbs-up to the Trump administration’s pushback against Britain’s demand that Apple compromise end-to-end encryption securing iCloud backups—which resulted in Westminster giving in to Washington.\n“Whoever is giving them advice on that particular policy matter has it dead right,” she says.\nThat’s also her advice for cybersecurity leaders in this administration going forward. “Listen to the technologists,” she says. “Go beyond the scope of whatever policy agenda has been given to you.”",

      "summary": "You might have noticed some of your coworkers are overly excited this week and counting down the minutes until midnight on October 3. No, these are not die-hard cinephiles devoted to the 2004 film Mean Girls (which features a joke about the date). They’re Taylor Swift fans.\nThe Life of a Showgirl, Swift’s 12th studio album, is set for release late Friday night. (So if the Swifties in the office seem overwhelmed, grant them grace; this is a big week.)\nHere’s everything you need to know about the album—in case you’re cornered by the coffee maker by someone with a friendship bracelet (the unofficial signifier of a Swift superfan).\nWhen and how did Swift announce The Life of a Showgirl?\nOn August 11, Swift’s website revealed a countdown to 12:12 a.m. ET on August 12. When time ran out, she announced The Life of a Showgirl and promised more details would be revealed on her later appearance on New Heights, her fiancé, Travis Kelce’s, podcast.\nHow did the Eras tour influence the new album?\nDuring her two-hour podcast conversation with brothers Travis and Jason Kelce, Swift revealed that the album was inspired by her experiences behind the scenes of the Eras tour. She wrote, produced, and recorded the majority of the album on the European leg in 2024. She would do three days of shows, then fly to Sweden to record.\nIt was hard but rewarding work: “I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating,” she said.\nWho is the creative team behind The Life of a Showgirl?\nFor this album, Swift teamed up with producers Max Martin and Shellback. The trio previously collaborated on tracks such as “22,” “Blank Space,” and “. . . Ready for It?” Longtime collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner did not work on this album.\n“These guys, they’re just geniuses,” Swift gushed on the podcast, referring to Martin and Shellback. “We’ve never actually made an album before where it’s just the three of us. There’s no other collaborators. It’s just the three of us making a focused album.”\nWhat do we know about the album’s tracks, titles, and first single?\nThere are just 12 tracks on the album, which is a big departure from Swift’s recent releases. The Tortured Poets Department turned into a surprise double album with 31 tracks. Midnights had 13 tracks, until Midnights (3am Edition) included 7 bonus tracks.\nBecause of Martin and Shellback’s involvement, we can guess this will be a more pop-centered album full of big showstopping numbers, and likely more upbeat and less folksy than recent releases from Swift.\n“It just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in my life,” the singer said on the New Heights podcast. “And so that effervescence has come through on this record.”\nThe first new single is “The Fate of Ophelia,” referencing William Shakespeare’s tragic character from Hamlet. The title track features Sabrina Carpenter, who opened for Swift in select cities during the Eras tour. She is the only known guest artist on the album at this time.\nHistorically, the fifth track of a Swift album is the most emotional. This time around, “Eldest Daughter” is slotted in that space.\nIs there also a movie?\nSwift is a master of public relations and marketing. To coincide with the album release, she is also “hosting” a movie event.\nTaylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl will feature behind-the-scenes footage, the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia,” and commentary on the creative process.\nThe 89-minute extravaganza will be shown in a limited number of theaters October 3 to 5.\nHow is Swift promoting The Life of a Showgirl?\nDuring release week, Swift is appearing on The Graham Norton Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Late Night With Seth Meyers.\nHer social media accounts have a calendar listing all the events leading up to the big day.\nWhy are Swift fans on standby?\nOne of these events is currently a mystery: Saturday, October 4, is simply listed as “standby.”\nSwifties, known for being internet detectives, are desperately trying to figure out what this means. Could it be a tour announcement, or a surprise Saturday Night Live appearance?\nAll will be revealed in time.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91413413/heavy-soda-tiktok-reddit-missouri-dr-pepper-mcdonalds-starbucks-pepsi",
      "summary": "Rumor has it that soda fountains at a handful of gas stations and convenience stores across the Midwest are serving a thicker, more syrupy variant—with extra sweetness. \nAptly dubbed “heavy soda,” the drink option can be traced back to a singular post on the subreddit r/Soda and a few TikTok videos. “You know when the gas station fountains have this option, you’re in God’s country,” creator Kate Boyer wrote in the caption of a post earlier this year. The video has since gained almost 7 million views. The drink has recently been reported on by a number of news organizations. \nNot to be confused with the recent dirty soda or protein soda trends, heavy soda is all about dialing up sweetness and flavor (also rumored to be the secret recipe behind McDonald’s fountain Coke superiority to all other types of Coke).\nThe soda fountain supposedly dispenses an extra blast of syrup, resulting in a sweeter, more concentrated version of popular sodas like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Dr Pepper. Taking it a step further, one TikToker, an employee at a movie theater, even claimed that coworkers skipped the water altogether and drank straight from the Mountain Dew syrup fountain. \nSome commenters have taken this as an opportunity to dunk on America’s sweet tooth culture. “Heavy soda is the most American culture,” one wrote. “God’s country is the reason we can’t have free healthcare,” another wrote. \nMany, however, protested their innocence, claiming they’ve never seen the heavy option out in the wild. “I’ve lived in and been all over the South most of my life, and I have never heard of or seen this anywhere,” one Reddit user responded. “This must be some very backwoods rural area place.”\nIt seems most of the confirmed sightings have been in Missouri. “For everyone asking, Heavy Pepsi is a Missouri thing,” one wrote. Another responded: “I’ve seen it in Missouri gas stations south of St. Louis. I tried the ‘heavy’ Mountain Dew. It’s way better than it should be.” \nAnother explained that the fountain option is ideal for those who need their Big Gulp to last all day, with the ice diluting the heavy soda over time to the perfect ratio, thereby avoiding a watered-down drink by the end of the day. \nViral soda recipes?\nWhile heavy soda may not have caught on in other parts of the U.S. just yet, companies like McDonald’s and Crumbl Cookies are trialing their own versions of viral soda recipes to capitalize on the social media-fueled frenzy for ultra-customized and made-to-order beverages. \nBeverages have been one of the hottest growth businesses for U.S. restaurants, The Wall Street Journal reported, with sales up 9.6% in 2024, the biggest annual increase of any restaurant category. At Starbucks, one-quarter of the chain’s custom drinks sold in the U.S. have more than three customer modifications—like an extra shot or pump of flavored syrup, a company spokeswoman recently told The New York Times.\nIn an era of personalization and “little treat” culture, an off-the-shelf soda no longer hits the same.",

      "summary": "Tesla has raised lease prices for all its vehicles in the U.S. after a $7,500 federal tax credit that helped boost electric vehicle sales expired, according to the company’s website on Wednesday.\nThe change follows the end of tax incentives under sweeping legislation passed by Congress, which eliminated the $7,500 credit for new EV leases and purchases, as well as a $4,000 credit for used EVs, effective September 30.\nTesla and its rivals had been passing these credits on to customers through competitive lease offers.\nThe monthly lease of the electric vehicle manufacturer’s best-selling Model Y increased to a range between $529 and $599, from a range of $479 to $529. Prices of all vehicles, however, remain unchanged.\nModel 3 lease prices touched a range of $429 to $759 per month, from a range of $349 to $699.\nDemand for battery-powered models is already showing signs of a slowdown after rapid growth earlier in the decade. Sales could drop after the credits dry up, auto executives and analysts have warned.\nReuters reported last month that Tesla’s U.S. market share dropped to a near eight-year low in August, as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals, according to data from research firm Cox Automotive.\nTesla, which once held more than 80% of the EV market in the United States, accounted for only 38% of the country’s total EV sales in August, according to early data from Cox.\n—By Nilutpal Timsina and Kanjyik Ghosh, Reuters",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414549/jane-goodall-death-wildlife-advocate-primate-expert",
      "summary": "Scientist and global activist Jane Goodall, who turned her childhood love of primates into a lifelong quest for protecting the environment, has died at the age of 91, the institute she founded said on Wednesday.\nGoodall died of natural causes while in California on a speaking tour, the Jane Goodall Institute said in a social media post.\n“Dr. Goodall’s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” it said on Instagram.\nThe primatologist-turned-conservationist spun her love of wildlife into a lifelong campaign that took her from a seaside English village to Africa and then across the globe in a quest to better understand chimpanzees, as well as the role that humans play in safeguarding their habitat and the planet’s health overall.\nGoodall was a pioneer in her field, both as a female scientist in the 1960s and for her work studying the behavior of primates. She created a path for a string of other women to follow suit, including the late Dian Fossey.\nShe also drew the public into the wild, partnering with the National Geographic Society to bring her beloved chimps into their lives through film, TV, and magazines.\nShe upended scientific norms of the time, giving chimpanzees names instead of numbers, observing their distinct personalities, and incorporating their family relationships and emotions into her work. She also found that, like humans, they use tools.\n“We have found that after all, there isn’t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom,” she said in a 2002 TED Talk.\nAs her career evolved, she shifted her focus from primatology to climate advocacy after witnessing widespread habitat devastation, urging the world to take quick and urgent action on climate change.\n“We’re forgetting that we’re part of the natural world,” she told CNN in 2020. “There’s still a window of time.”\nIn 2003, she was appointed a Dame of the British Empire and, in January 2025, she received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nKenya-bound\nBorn in London in 1934 and then growing up in Bournemouth on England’s south coast, Goodall had long dreamed of living among wild animals. She said her passion for animals, stoked by the gift of a stuffed toy gorilla from her father, grew as she immersed herself in books such as Tarzan and Dr. Dolittle.\nShe set her dreams aside after leaving school, unable to afford university. She worked as a secretary and then for a film company until a friend’s invitation to visit Kenya put the jungle—and its inhabitants—within reach.\nAfter saving up money for the journey by boat, Goodall arrived in the East African nation in 1957. There, an encounter with famed anthropologist and paleontologist Dr. Louis Leakey and his wife, archaeologist Mary Leakey, set her on course to work with primates.\nUnder Leakey, Goodall set up the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve, later renamed the Gombe Stream Research Centre, near Lake Tanganyika in present-day Tanzania. There she discovered chimpanzees ate meat, fought fierce wars, and perhaps most importantly, fashioned tools in order to eat termites.\n“Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as humans,” Leakey said of the discovery.\nAlthough she eventually paused her research to earn a PhD at Cambridge University, Goodall remained in the jungle for years. Her first husband and frequent collaborator was wildlife cameraman Hugo van Lawick.\nThrough the National Geographic’s coverage, the chimpanzees at Gombe Stream soon became household names—most famously, one Goodall called David Greybeard for his silver streak of hair.\nNearly 30 years after first arriving in Africa, however, Goodall said she realized she could not support or protect the chimpanzees without addressing the dire disappearance of their habitat. She said she realized she would have to look beyond Gombe, leave the jungle, and take up a larger global role as a conservationist.\nIn 1977, she set up the Jane Goodall Institute, a nonprofit organization aimed at supporting the research in Gombe as well as conservation and development efforts across Africa. Its work has since expanded worldwide and includes efforts to tackle environmental education, health, and advocacy.\nShe made a new name for herself, traveling an average of 300 days a year to meet with local officials in countries around the world and speaking with community and school groups. She continued touring to the end of her life, speaking at Climate Week in New York City just last week.\nShe later expanded the institute to include Roots & Shoots, a conservation program aimed at children.\nIt was a stark shift from her isolated research, spending long days watching chimpanzees.\n“It never ceases to amaze me that there’s this person who travels around and does all these things,” she told The New York Times during a 2014 trip to Burundi and back to Gombe. “And it’s me. It doesn’t seem like me at all.”\nA prolific author, she published more than 30 books with her observations, including her 1999 bestseller Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey, as well as a dozen aimed at children.\nGoodall said she never doubted the planet’s resilience or human ability to overcome environmental challenges.\n“Yes, there is hope . . . it’s in our hands, it’s in your hands and my hands, and those of our children. It’s really up to us,” she said in 2002, urging people to “leave the lightest possible ecological footprints.”\nShe had one son, known as “Grub,” with van Lawick, whom she divorced in 1974. Van Lawick died in 2002. In 1975, she married Derek Bryceson. He died in 1980.\n—By Susan Heavey; additional reporting by Kanishka Singh, Reuters",

      "summary": "Not even half of the spots in the 48-team field have been claimed. The schedule of matches won’t be finalized until December. And other than host nations U.S., Canada, and Mexico, nobody has any idea where or when they’ll be playing.\nMillions of soccer fans worldwide evidently don’t seem to mind any of those points.\nTickets to next year’s FIFA World Cup officially go on sale Wednesday. The buyers will be those who were selected, out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month, to have the first formal chance to purchase tickets over the next few days. FIFA said lottery winners have been, or will soon be, informed by email.\nThere are unique questions for consumers heading into the tournament, particularly about how they’ll get visas, if necessary, to visit the U.S. as the country cracks down on immigration. There are also more traditional concerns such as who, when, and where—and none of those will be answered until the draw on December 5. FIFA [short for Fédération Internationale de Football Association] knows many fans won’t fret about those answers; they just want tickets now and will figure out the rest later.\n“These are not only outstanding figures, but also a strong statement,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on social media, reacting to the 4.5 million applicants for a spot in the purchase window that opened Wednesday. “The whole world wants to be part of the FIFA World Cup 26, the biggest, most inclusive, and most exciting event ever. From Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to countries big and small across every continent, fans are proving once again that passion for football truly unites.”\nIn divided times, the notion of soccer being something that “truly unites” will be put to the test.\nHere are some things to know as tickets go on sale.\nWhat’s for sale?\nFans can purchase seats in one of four categories; Category 1 has the best seats, while Category 4 has seats somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket prices will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final, but could—and almost certainly will—change as soccer’s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.\nThere are other ways to get tickets other than shelling out big bucks. American Airlines announced last month that its AAdvantage loyalty program members can redeem miles for World Cup tickets, starting October 13 for Executive Platinum and ConciergeKey members; then October 14 for Platinum Pro, Platinum, and Gold members; followed on October 15 by all members.\nAnd starting Thursday, some Verizon customers will have access to free World Cup tickets and other perks. The telecommunications giant is a World Cup sponsor and will simply start dropping free ticket chances to its customers through its app.\n“For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that’s on or oﬀ the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament,” said soccer icon David Beckham, part of Verizon’s promotion for the World Cup.\nWho’s in?\nThe U.S., Mexico, and Canada all automatically qualified as host nations. Also in so far: defending champion Argentina, Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, South Korea, Brazil, Australia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Tunisia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Morocco.\nThat leaves 30 spots still unclaimed.\nFIFA said fans from 216 countries and territories applied to be part of the first ticket lottery. The top three nations of interest, to no surprise, were the hosts: the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, in that order. The rest of the top 10, also in order of application totals: Germany, England, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain, and Italy.\nNobody has said how many tickets FIFA plans to sell in this first window. Availability won’t be depleted; based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches around 16 North American venues, though it’s unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.\nWill visitors travel to the U.S.?\nThere is an immigration crackdown unfolding across the U.S., which could dampen overseas interest in traveling to the country. U.S. tourism officials already have noted a drop in overseas visitors this year, and even organizers in some U.S. host cities have acknowledged that political dynamics may have an impact on attendance.\nAdding to some of the uncertainty, President Donald Trump, who has a close relationship with Infantino, has suggested that the host cities could be changed if he wants to move some events away from places his administration considers unsafe.\nThe U.S. cities that are scheduled to host are East Rutherford, New Jersey; Inglewood, California; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Houston; Arlington, Texas; Atlanta; Seattle; Santa Clara, California; Philadelphia; Kansas City, Missouri; and Miami Gardens, Florida.\n“If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup . . . we won’t allow it to go there,” Trump said last week. “We’ll move it around a little bit. But I hope that’s not going to happen.”\nThe State Department says that “the safety and security of the United States” along with “World Cup matches, athletes, fans, and venues” are the top priorities with regard to its role in the World Cup process. It also suggests that travelers who need a visa should start applying now, and officials have said the U.S. is trying “to ensure an efficient, smooth, and effective visa process.”\nWhat’s next?\nA second phase, called an early ticket draw, likely will run from October 27-31, with purchase time slots from mid-November to early December. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on December 5 determines the World Cup schedule.\nTickets also will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform.\nSome tickets already have been snagged; hospitality packages have been sold since May.\n“The world will come together in North America,” Infantino promised, “like never before.”\nThe tournament runs from June 11 through July 19.\n—By Tim Reynolds, AP sports writer",

      "title": "AOL discontinues its dial-up internet service that shaped a generation",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414381/aol-ends-dial-up-internet-service",
      "summary": "It’s official: AOL’s dial-up internet has taken its last bow.\nAOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (September 30)—writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it “routinely evaluates” its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software “optimized for older operating systems,” from its plans.\nDial-up is now no longer advertised on AOL’s website. As of Wednesday, former company help pages like “Connect to the internet with AOL Dialer” appeared unavailable—and nostalgic social media users took to the internet to say their final goodbyes.\nAOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the World Wide Web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online—along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.\nEventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up’s quirks for most people accessing the internet today—but not everyone.\nA handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.\nWhile AOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, it wasn’t the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet’s earlier days continue to disappear.\nMicrosoft retired its video calling service Skype earlier this year—as well as its Internet Explorer browser back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger—a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.\nAOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago—when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its “You’ve got mail” catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.\nBefore it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL’s market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL—which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.\nAOL now operates under the larger Yahoo name. A spokesperson for Yahoo didn’t have any additional statements about the end of AOL’s dial-up when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday, directing customers to its previous summer announcement.\nAt the time, Verizon sold AOL in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands”—down from 2.1 million when Verizon first moved to acquire AOL in 2015, and far below peak demand seen back in the ’90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.\n—By Wyatte Grantham-Philips, AP business writer",

      "title": "Amazon debuts new grocery brand with nearly everything under $5",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91414414/amazon-debuts-new-grocery-brand-with-nearly-everything-under-5",
      "summary": "Amazon is pushing deeper into the grocery aisle with the launch of Amazon Grocery, a food brand that keeps most prices under $5.\nThe idea of buying much of anything for $5 seems like a distant memory for most shoppers these days, as President Trump’s tariffs and persistent inflation keep the price of everyday consumer goods high, with little relief in sight. Keenly aware of that, Amazon is looking to undercut the competition’s prices with its own newly unified private-label brand featuring everything from eggs and premade salads to ground beef and olive oil. The company plans to expand its offerings to more grocery staples like frozen pasta, granola, and cakes in the coming months.\nThe company says that its new Amazon Grocery brand will merge its existing Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly brands into a single storefront for essentials. In its online grocery store, many items have already been relabeled digitally away from the Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands and given a makeover with a “modern, clean and distinctive” new design so shoppers can spot the line of core items easily, much like Target does with its in-house Good & Gather line. The new, rebranded Amazon Grocery lineup of products is now available online and through the company’s brick-and-mortar Amazon Fresh stores.\n“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste—from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials—all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery stores and Whole Foods Market CEO, said in a press release.\nAmazon’s big grocery push\nOn paper, Amazon is trying to make its branding less confusing, differentiating its core grocery line from its other in-house brands like 365 from Whole Foods. But a year ago, Amazon made a similar announcement, hailing a value-minded “new private-label brand” called Amazon Saver. \n“From crackers and cookies to canned fruit and condiments, Amazon Saver offers affordable grocery essentials at a great value both in-store and online,” the company wrote in a press release at the time, highlighting that most Amazon Saver products would be priced under $5. Somewhat confusingly, the company claims that the new Amazon Grocery brand will complement its portfolio of private label products, including Amazon Saver, which apparently isn’t going away.\nIt’s been almost a decade since Amazon bought Whole Foods in a then-shocking $13.7 billion deal that revealed the extent of the company’s master plan to dominate even offline shopping. The company’s commitment to push deeper into selling wallet-friendly fridge and pantry staples is a sign that Amazon’s ambitions in the space haven’t yet been fully realized. \nIn August, Amazon introduced same-day delivery service for perishable foods in 1,000 additional U.S. cities, with plans to double that coverage by the end of the year. The company’s ongoing aggressive expansion into on-demand grocery delivery puts the undisputed king of shopping on a collision course with grocery delivery competitors like Walmart, Target, and Instacart. \nNot all of Amazon’s grocery experiments have been successful. Last month, the company announced that it would close all of its Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K. after “a thorough evaluation of business operations.” At the same time, the company noted its plans to expand its online grocery sales, doubling down on the “very substantial growth opportunities” in online grocery delivery.",

      "url": "https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/ki-risiken-der-produktentwicklung",
      "summary": "In Kürze: KI-Risiken Produktentwicklung\nKI ist in den Händen eines kompetenten Anwenders ungeheuer hilfreich. Sie kann die Forschung beschleunigen, Erkenntnisse liefern und bessere Entscheidungen unterstützen. Aber die KI-Evangelisten verschweigen, dass sie ebenso schädlich sein kann, wenn grundlegende KI-Risiken ignoriert werden.\nDas Hauptrisiko besteht darin, dass die Produktstrategie schrittweise von den Product Leaders auf die technischen Systeme übertragen wird, oftmals ohne dass jemand entschieden hat, dass dies geschehen soll. Teams fügen „KI“ hinzu und berichten oft über mehr Output, aber nicht über mehr „Lernen“. Dieses Muster stimmt mit langjährigen Erkenntnissen über menschliche Beweggründe überein: Unter Zeitdruck vertrauen Menschen zunehmend auf automatisierte Hinweise und praktizieren zu wenig unabhängige Überprüfung, was sich als besonders problematisch erweist, wenn die Automatisierung probabilistisch und nicht deterministisch ist (Parasuraman & Riley, 1997; siehe alle unten aufgeführten Quellen). Das ist nicht in erster Linie ein Versagen des Modells, sondern ein Versagen des Systems und der Entscheidungsfindung, das durch KI noch beschleunigt wird.\n\nDrei Mechanismen, die das Produktdenken zerstören\nUm die KI-Risiken zu verstehen, müssen die zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen untersucht werden, die diese Probleme verursachen und nicht nur die Symptome katalogisiert werden.\nMechanismus Eins: Übermäßiges Vertrauen → Erosion der Empirie\nUnter Termindruck werden probabilistische Ergebnisse als Fakten behandelt. Die bewährte Taxonomie von Parasuraman und Riley, Gebrauch, Missbrauch, Nichtgebrauch, Missbrauch, sagt dieses Abgleiten von aktiver Sinnfindung zu passiver Akzeptanz voraus. In der Produktarbeit äußert sich dies darin, dass Product Owner und Produktmanager unklare KI-Empfehlungen unhinterfragt akzeptieren und dabei den Überblick darüber verlieren, wie die Entscheidungen getroffen wurden und ob sie überprüft werden können.\nDie gefährlichste Form dieses Übervertrauens ist die Voreingenommenheit für die Automatisierung. Die Forschung zeigt immer wieder, dass Menschen sich zu sehr auf automatisierte Systeme verlassen, während sie deren Leistung zu wenig überwachen; ein Muster, das in allen Bereichen von der Luftfahrt bis zur medizinischen Diagnose zu beobachten ist (Parasuraman & Manzey, 2010). Teams laufen Gefahr, KI-generierte Empfehlungen selbst dann überzugewichten, wenn sie den Erkenntnissen vor Ort widersprechen, was die empirische Prozesskontrolle grundlegend untergräbt.\nDas Korrektiv besteht darin, Hypothesen wieder in den Prozess einzubringen: Jede KI-beeinflusste Entscheidung sollte ein dreiteiliges Artefakt hervorbringen: Behauptung, Test und vordefinierte Aktion. Dadurch wird die hypothesengesteuerte Entwicklung auf die alltägliche Produktarbeit angewandt, wodurch die Geschwindigkeit beibehalten und gleichzeitig das Lernen gefördert wird.\nMechanismus Zwei: Optimierungskraft → Frisieren der Metriken (Goodhart-Effekte)\nWenn ein stellvertretender Wert zum Ziel erhoben wird, ist dieser nicht mehr effektiv; Optimierungen zugunsten dieses Wertes verstärkt den Schaden. Dies ist der Kern der Goodhart-Effekte in der KI und der Literatur zum Spezifikationsspiel, die Systeme dokumentiert, die das geschriebene Ziel maximieren und gleichzeitig das beabsichtigte Ergebnis untergraben (Manheim & Garrabrant, 2018).\nDeepMinds Forschung zum Spezifikationsspiel zeigt, wie KI-Systeme unerwartete Wege finden, um hohe Punktzahlen zu erreichen, während sie das beabsichtigte Ziel völlig untergraben. In Produktkontexten heißt das „grüne Dashboards, rote Kunden“, oder: Die Klickrate steigt, während das Vertrauen oder die Kundenbindung sinkt.\nAbkürzungen zur Validierung von Annahmen sind ein Beispiel für diesen Mechanismus. Teams riskieren es, von der KI generierte Wertehypothesen zu akzeptieren, ohne sie auszuprobieren. Die Vorhersage der KI über den Wert, die in jeder Hinsicht ein bloßer Stellvertreter ist, wird als Wert selbst behandelt, wodurch perfekt optimierte Metriken entstehen, die gefährlich weit vom realen Erfolg entfernt sind.\nMechanismus Drei: Verzerrtes Feedback → Konvergenz und Homogenisierung\nDie von der KI vermittelten „Erkenntnisse“ sind überzeugend und können den direkten Kundenkontakt verdrängen, wodurch sich selbst verstärkende Kreisläufe entstehen, die sich von der Realität entfernen. Die Forschung zeigt, dass das Problem real ist: KI-Systeme, die aus ihren eigenen Ergebnissen lernen, verschlimmern Verzerrungen (Ensign et al., 2018), und Empfehlungssysteme machen alles immer ähnlicher, ohne tatsächlich nützlicher zu sein (Chaney et al., 2018).\nDieser Mechanismus führt zu einer Erosion der Produktvision. KI ist hervorragend in der lokalen Optimierung, hat aber Schwierigkeiten mit bahnbrechendem „Denken“. Wenn sich Teams bei der strategischen Ausrichtung stark auf KI verlassen, besteht die Gefahr, dass sie für historische Muster optimieren und dabei neue Chancen verpassen. Das System, das auf seine eigenen Ergebnisse und die Reaktionen der Benutzer trainiert ist, filtert allmählich die unterschiedlichen, außergewöhnlichen Perspektiven heraus, die echte Innovationen hervorbringen könnten.\nDer Niedergang des Kundenverständnisses folgt demselben Muster. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass KI-Personas für die Teams realer werden als tatsächliche Kunden. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass Produktentscheidungen durch algorithmische Interpretationen gefiltert werden, statt durch direkte Interaktion mit dem Kunden. Dadurch wird die wesentliche menschliche Verbindung unterbrochen, die großartige Produkte von technisch kompetent gelieferten Fehlschlägen unterscheidet.\nSystemische Ursachen: Warum intelligente Organisationen diese Fehler zulassen\nDiese Mechanismen treten immer wieder auf, weil Anreize „Ankündigungen über Ergebnisse“ und „Geschwindigkeit über Lernen“ belohnen, während es vielen Teams an der Fähigkeit mangelt, Korrelation von Kausalität zu unterscheiden und Falsifizierbarkeit zu wahren. Die Governance vervollständigt die Falle: Risikoprozesse gehen von Determinismus aus, aber KI ist probabilistisch.\nOrganisatorische Faktoren führen zu systematischer Blindheit. Der Druck zu „datengesteuerten“ Entscheidungen ohne empirische Bestätigung wird zu einem Organisationsfetisch (Brynjolfsson & McElheran, 2016). Unternehmen laufen Gefahr, dem Anschein von Objektivität zu huldigen, während sie die tatsächliche evidenzbasierte Praxis aufgeben.\nKulturelle Faktoren verschärfen das Problem. Technologieverehrung und der Glaube, dass Algorithmen objektive, unvoreingenommene Lösungen liefern, ersetzen das kritische Denken. Es entstehen anti-empirische Muster, bei denen Teams die Autorität von Algorithmen der evidenzbasierten Validierung vorziehen.\nDas NIST AI Risk Management Framework ist eindeutig: Vertrauenswürdige KI erfordert eine kontextspezifische Risikoidentifizierung, eine Dokumentation der Annahmen und eine kontinuierliche Überwachung, die nicht zufällig entsteht (NIST AI RMF, 2023). Diese Erwartungen müssen operationalisiert werden.\nKI-Risiken und die Produktkatastrophe: Wenn die Mechanismen konvergieren\nWenn diese Risiken im Produktkontext zusammenkommen, können die Ergebnisse vorhersehbar und verheerend sein. Die Teams laufen Gefahr, die Rückkopplungsschleifen mit den tatsächlichen Kunden zu verlieren und die direkte Interaktion durch KI-vermittelte Erkenntnisse zu ersetzen. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass Features für historische Kennzahlen optimiert werden, statt für die zukünftige Wertschöpfung. Roadmaps laufen Gefahr, zu einer Übung in Mustererkennung zu werden und nicht zu einer strategischen Vision.\nAm gefährlichsten ist, dass Produktentscheidungen eher technokratisch als kundenorientiert werden. Forschungen über algorithmische Entscheidungsfindung legen nahe, dass Teams mit technischen KI-Kenntnissen einen unverhältnismäßig großen Einfluss auf strategische Entscheidungen gewinnen können (Kellogg et al., 2020). Datenwissenschaftler und Entwickler könnten anfangen, Produktentscheidungen allein zu treffen. Im Gegensatz dazu werden Product Owner und Produktmanager zu KI-Operatoren, eine Dynamik, die in anderen Bereichen zu beobachten ist, in denen algorithmische Tools die Kontrolle von Domänenexperten auf technische Operatoren übertragen.\nDas gefährlichste Szenario tritt ein, wenn mehrere Risiken zusammenkommen: Organisatorische Command- und Control-Strukturen plus technologische Verehrung plus Wettbewerbsdruck schaffen ein Umfeld, in dem das Infragestellen von KI zu einem Karrierehemmnis wird. In diesem Zusammenhang besteht die Gefahr, dass die Produktstrategie von den Geschäftsführern auf technische Systeme übertragen wird, ohne dass jemand dies ausdrücklich beschlossen hat.\nEvidence-Basierte Antworten zur Minderung von KI-Risiken\nEine glaubwürdige Antwort muss operativ sein, nicht theatralisch. Behandeln Sie KI wie einen talentierten Junior-Analysten, schnell, unermüdlich, gelegentlich auf gefährliche Weise falsch, und umhüllen Sie ihn mit Empirie, Herausforderung, Reversibilität und Transparenz.\nEmpirismus als Standard\nVerwenden Sie das Entscheidungs-Tripel (Behauptung, Test, Aktion) bei jeder KI-beeinflussten Entscheidung; fügen Sie es jedem Produktvorschlag bei, damit Sie diesen anhand von Beweisen überprüfen und anpassen können. So bleibt die Geschwindigkeit erhalten und der Lernprozess wird fortgesetzt:\n\nDie Behauptung: Was ist die spezifische, falsifizierbare Behauptung, die das Modell aufstellt?\nDer Test: Wie können wir diese Aussage mit einem günstigen, schnellen Experiment validieren?\nDie Aktion: Was werden wir tun, wenn der Test erfolgreich ist?\n\nDieser Ansatz wendet die Prinzipien der hypothesengesteuerten Entwicklung auf die tägliche Produktarbeit an und stellt sicher, dass KI-Empfehlungen zu überprüfbaren Behauptungen werden und nicht zu akzeptierten Wahrheiten.\nLeichtgewichtige Herausforderung\nSetzen Sie ein 15-minütiges „Red Team“ in rotierender Zusammensetzung ein, um die wichtigsten Empfehlungen zu hinterfragen, z. B. alternative Hypothesen, Datenreihen und Fehlermöglichkeiten. Strukturierte Zweifel reduzieren messbar den Automatisierungsmissbrauch, wenn sie mit einem ständigen Goodhart-Check gepaart werden: „Welcher Proxy könnte der Mission schaden?“\nReparieren Sie die Feedback-Schleife\nSchreiben Sie wöchentliche direkte Benutzergespräche für Produktmanager, POs und Designer vor; KI kann Protokolle zusammenfassen, darf diese aber nicht ersetzen. Dies wirkt den bekannten Pathologien der Feedback-Schleife und der Homogenisierung von Empfehlungen entgegen und erhält die direkte Verbindung zum Kunden aufrecht, die für bahnbrechende Erkenntnisse unerlässlich ist.\nReversibilität und Widerstandsfähigkeit\nBevorzugen Sie Architekturen und Release-Praktiken, die es ermöglichen, Änderungen sicher auszuprobieren und leicht rückgängig zu machen: Canary-Releases und Rollbacks, fehlerbudgetgesteuerte Änderungskontrolle und umkehrbare (Zwei-Wege-Tür-)Entscheidungen. Bei tieferen Verstrickungen mit Anbietern verwenden Sie eine evolutionäre Architektur mit Fitnessfunktionen und das Strangler-Fig-Muster, um einen expliziten „Ausstieg in 30 Tagen“-Pfad einzuhalten. (Quellen siehe unten.)\nDiese Praktiken beruhen auf den Grundsätzen des Site Reliability Engineering, bei dem ein Ausfall als unvermeidlich angesehen wird und die Systeme eher für eine schnelle Wiederherstellung als für eine perfekte Prävention optimiert werden.\nTransparenz, die günstig und Standard ist\nNutzen Sie Protokollabfragen, Modellbezeichner, Eingabequellen und Ein-Satz-Begründungen für folgenreiche Entscheidungen: Dies ermöglicht die Behebung von Fehlentwicklungen und die Erläuterung von Entscheidungen, wenn die Realität nicht mit den Vorhersagen übereinstimmt. Außerdem entspricht dies den NIST-Richtlinien zur Dokumentation und kontinuierlichen Überwachung.\nFazit: Die Messlatte für das Produktmanagement höher legen\nKI verstärkt das, was Ihr Operating Modell bereits ist. In einem starken System, das empirisch, neugierig und transparent ist, verstärkt KI das Lernen; in einem schwachen System beschleunigt sie das Scheitern. Es geht nicht um den Glauben an Modelle, sondern darum, ob Sie probabilistische Vorschläge in zuverlässige, überprüfbare Entscheidungen umwandeln können, ohne den Kern Ihres Produkts zu verlieren.\nDie Unternehmen, die das herausfinden, werden Produkte bauen, die tatsächlich von Bedeutung sind. Diejenigen, die diesen Test nicht bestehen, werden perfekt auf Irrelevanz hin optimiert und Systeme schaffen, die sich durch hervorragende Metriken auszeichnen, aber die Bedürfnisse der Kunden nicht erfüllen.\nLassen Sie die Verantwortung bei den Menschen. Halten Sie die Feedback-Schleifen kurz. Bewerten Sie den Beweis höher als das Vertrauen, dass es schon funktioniert. Setzen Sie auf Lernen, nicht auf einen irrationalen Glauben an die Technologie.\nQuellen aus dem Artikel über KI-Risiken\n\nAmazon (2015).
