      "summary": "If you’re on the market for a Kindle, Fire TV device or Echo speaker, Amazon Prime Day is basically Black Friday for you. Prime Day deals on those devices are typically the same (or very close to) the prices we see at the end of the year near the holidays. That means now is a great time to pick up a new Kindle ereader, a Fire TV Stick for streaming while traveling or an Echo speaker for your home office. As expected, almost all of Amazon’s hardware is on sale for Prime Big Deal Days; these are the best October Prime Day deals on Amazon gear that you can get this year.\n \nPrime Day Kindle deals\n \n \n \nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\n  \nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\n \nKindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\n \nKindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\n \nPrime Day Echo deals\n \n \n \nEcho Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system.\n \nEcho Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy.\n \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design, improved speakers and added Alexa chops. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems.\n \nEcho Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\n \nEcho Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\n \nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n \n \n \nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\n \nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\n \nFire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\n \nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n \n \n \nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\n \nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\n \nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\n \nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-deals-on-kindles-echo-speakers-fire-tv-devices-and-more-for-prime-day-081210730.html?src=rss",

A number of Lego sets from the Super Mario and Star Wars collections are already on sale for up to 38 percent off.\n \nWhen shopping for Lego sets on Amazon, we highly recommend checking a price tracker like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel before buying.

      "summary": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference to intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to core operating system functions. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only do these Prime Day SSD deals cover some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time.\n \nBest Prime Day SSD deals\n \n \n \n \n \nCrucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 ($25 off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too.\n \n \nCrucial P310 2TB for $112 ($38 off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s, plus a built-in heatsink and more efficient use of the device battery.\n \n \nSamsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use.\n \n \nSamsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink.\n \n \nSamsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $370 (35 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now.\n \n \nSamsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.\n \n \nKingston Fury Renegade G5 for $170 (48 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing.\n \n \nWD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 ($30 off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel.\n \n \nBest Prime Day portable SSD deals\n \n \n \n \n \nSanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 ($60 off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters.\n \n \nKingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height.\n \n \nSeagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.\n \n \nBest Prime Day microSD card deals\n \n \n \n \n \nSamsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming.\n \n \nSanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $100 (33 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-deals-save-on-gear-from-samsung-sandisk-crucial-and-others-170039457.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Maybe you’re not looking to snag an iPad, a robot vacuum or a VR headset this Amazon Prime Day because you’re set with what you already have. Instead, though, consider picking up a few discounted “essential” gadgets, or really, devices you don’t want to be left without in a pinch. Charging gear falls into this camp, and Anker makes some of our favorite power banks, cables, wireless chargers and more.\n \nA bunch of Anker’s gear is on sale for October Prime Day, making now a great time to stock up. Personally, I always end up getting an extra charging cable or surge protector for my house, or I take stock of the gifts I’ll need over the next couple of months and pick up a power brick while they’re deeply discounted. Here, we’ve collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging accessories so you don’t have to go searching for them.\n  \nAnker Prime Day deals: Power banks\n \nPower banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more.\n \nIt's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers\n \nA good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up.\n \nWe recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnker Prime Day deals: Charging gear\n \nPlenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-best-prime-day-anker-deals-on-power-banks-wireless-chargers-and-other-accessories-164536745.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "This October Prime Day, we've collected a list of the best Amazon Big Deal Days discounts on both traditional and robotic vacuums. We're hoping this article can do more than just save you money — it's also designed to help you with the fiddliest vacuum-related decisions. Should you go corded, cordless or robotic? Dyson, Tineco or Shark? Are there any decent robot vacuums that aren't Roombas? (Yes.) As the event goes on, we'll search for the best Prime Day vacuum deals as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best discounts here.\n \nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n \n \n \n \n \nShark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 ($50 off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work.\n \n \nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into.\n \n \nDreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums.\n \n \nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors.\n \n \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more.\n \n \niRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 ($210 off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely.\n \n \nRoborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 ($100 off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app.\n \n \nRoborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 ($350 off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet.\n \n \nEcovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 ($500): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains.\n \n \nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n \n \n \n \n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \n \nShark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 ($70 off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings.\n \n \nShark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 ($90 off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets.\n \n \nShark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners.\n \n \nDyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in.\n \n \nDyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 ($230 off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed.\n \n \nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are.\n \n \nBlack+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "You don’t have to spend a lot of money to take part in Amazon’s latest Prime Day Sale. Everything listed here is currently going for less than $25 and includes tech like speakers, mice, smart plugs, cables, wall adapters and power banks that fall below that price point. And these aren’t just any products with a pulse — we pulled these from Engadget’s buying guides, gift recommendations and reviews so it’s all stuff we’ve tested and currently recommend. Prime Day is yet again a good time to stock up on small essentials — Here are the best Prime Day tech deals for less than $25.\n \nPrime Day tech deals under $25\n \n \n \nChipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our current top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it.\n  \nBlink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nAudible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point.\n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nKasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights.\n \nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a  Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.\n \nBelkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide.\n \n \n \nAnker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades.\n \nAnker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 ($16 off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more.\n \nAnker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.\n \nAnker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. \n \n \n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.\n \nPebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing.\n \nRing Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events.\n \nEcho Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.\n \nJLab Go Air Pop+ for $17 ($13 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.\n \nAmazon Basics Smart LED Light Bulb for $9 ($3 off with Prime): We didn’t test this one for our smart bulb guide, but it’s tough to argue with this price — and I’ve found the smart plug equivalent of this device to be one of the more reliable bits of smart home tech I’ve tried. Like all Amazon smart home gear, this only works with Alexa devices like an Echo speaker (and any smartphone).\n \nSamsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.\n \nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $19 ($16 off): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-tech-deals-under-25-save-on-blink-anker-roku-and-fire-tv-084136589.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Prime Day sales are a great opportunity to nab an expensive bit of shiny new tech you’ve been eying — it’s also an excellent time to get a discount on smaller electronics and accessories. For this list, we compared what’s on sale right now with the stuff we recommend in our guides. For less than $50 each, we found deals on some of our favorite tech including batteries, iPhone paraphernalia, mice, earbuds, speakers, holiday gifts and smart home gear. Some deals require you to be a Prime member, others are open to anyone with half a Benjamin earmarked for Amazon. Here are the best October Prime Day tech deals under $50. \n \nBest Prime Day deals under $50\n \n \n \nAmazon Echo Buds for $15 ($35 off): We named these the best open-design pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They’re lightweight, have automatic wear detection and built-in assistance from Alexa. Just remember an open ear design blocks no noise and the battery life here isn’t the most robust. This Lightning deal matches the all-time low but is set to expire in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. \n  \nBeats Pill for $50 ($100 off with Prime): Here’s one of our picks for best portable Bluetooth speakers. Only the Kim Kardashian version in light or dark grey is on sale, but other than the marketing they’re the same speaker as the other Beats Pills.\n \nApple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere.\n \nAudible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point.\n \nMoft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work someplace away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories.\n \nUGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip.\n \nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $37 ($18 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device.\n \nAnker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades.\n \nInstant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen.\n \nElgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling.\n \nINIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator.\n \n \n \nLego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die.\n \nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.\n \n—> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals.\n \nAnker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.\n \nChipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it.\n \nPebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks.\n \nBlink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price.\n \nBlink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech.\n \nRing Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. \n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. \n \n—> Want spend no more than $25 on this sale? Check out our list of the super cheap stuff. \n \n \n \nAnker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.\n \nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\n \nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\n \nOtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it.\n \nRing Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. \n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nUltimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build.\n \nAnker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites.\n \nAnker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide.\n \nTwelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment.\n \nLevoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room.\n \n8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50.\n \n \n \nAnker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable.\n \nEcho Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.\n \nElden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games.\n \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\n \n—> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's gaming deals roundup. \n \nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart.\n \nBelkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide.\n \nUltimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling.\n \nSamsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it.\n \nBelkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem.\n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \nBlink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on.\n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.\n \nMoft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation.\n \nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.\n \nAnker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size.\n \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.\n \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount.\n \nAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.\n \nJLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "So you need a new laptop — now’s the time of year to look out for one on sale. October Prime Day, as has been in years past, offers a ton of laptop deals to consider. All kinds of devices are on sale this year for Big Deal Days, from refreshed MacBooks to high-end gaming machines to already affordable notebooks. But sussing out a good deal from a just-ok deal (or even worse, a bad deal all together), can be a challenge. Laptop prices on Amazon are all over the place even when it’s not Prime Day depending on the configuration of the notebook, the brand, the seller and a bunch of other factors.\n \nThis is where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. As always, if you’re super particular about the display panel you want in your next laptop, or you know you want to get as much RAM as possible, we recommend going straight to manufacturers to customize your next PC. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop.\n  \nBest Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks\n \n \n \nApple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros).\n \n \n \nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 (17 percent off)\n \n \nApple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off)\n \n \nApple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off)\n \n \nBest Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops\n \nYou’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot.\n \n \n \n \n \nHP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off)\n \n \nLenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off)\n \n \nAcer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off)\n \n \nDell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off)\n \n \nAlienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,180 (16 percent off)\n \n \nBest Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks\n \nMost Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day.

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-and-ai-fashion-industry",
      "summary": "When you’re buying a new item of clothing, you probably don’t give much thought to the design and assembly processes the garment went through before arriving at the store.\nCreating a piece of apparel starts with a designer sketching out an idea. Then a pattern is made, the fabric is chosen and cut, and the garment is sewed. Finally the clothing is packaged and shipped.\nTo expedite the process, some apparel companies now use 3D technologies including design software, body scans, visualization, and 3D printers. The tools allow designers to envision their creations in a variety of colors, fabrics, and motifs. Avatars known as digital twins are created to simulate how the clothes will look and fit on different body types. Body scans generate measurements for better-fitting clothing and improved product design.\nSome manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence to streamline operations, and additional companies likely will explore it as it becomes more accurate.\nNot all garment makers are utilizing 3D technologies to their fullest potential, however.\nTo advance 3D technology for designers, manufacturers, and retailers, the 3D Retail Coalition holds an annual challenge that spotlights academic institutions and startups that are leading the way. The contest is cosponsored by the IEEE Standards Association Industry Connections 3D Body Processing program, which works with the clothing industry to create standards for technology that uses 3D scans to create digital models.\nThe winners of this year’s contest were selected in June at the PI Apparel Fashion Tech Show, held in New York City.\nThe Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) placed first in the academic category. The New York City school offers programs in design, fashion, art, communications, and business.\nPixaScale won the startup category. Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.\nCustom-made clothing by 3D and AI\nIll-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent, according to PrimeAI.\nTo make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.\nReturns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.\nSome customers can’t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.\n“What if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?” posits Leigh LaVange, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.\nThat was the idea behind LaVange’s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.\n“I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can’t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.” —Leigh LaVange\n“I see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,” she says.\nThe short-term proposal involves measuring a person’s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips—either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer’s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person’s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.\nLaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.\nHer long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer’s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer’s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.\nBecause her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.\n“Most manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,” she says. “I believe there’s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly. I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can’t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.”\nA digital asset management platform\nThe winning submission in the startup category, AI-First DAM [digital asset management] as an Intelligent Backbone for Agile Product Development, uses 3D technology and AI to combine components of clothing design into a centralized platform.\nKristian Sons, chief executive of Pixascale, launched the startup in February. He left Adidas in January after nine years at the company, where he was the technical lead for digital creation.\nMany apparel companies, Sons says, still store their 3D files on employees’ local drives or on Microsoft’s SharePoint, a Web-based document-management system.\nThose methods make things difficult because not everyone has access.\nSons’ cloud-based platform addresses the issue by sharing digital assets, such as images, videos, 3D models, base styles, and documents, to all parties involved in the process.\nThat includes designers, seamstresses, and manufacturers. His system integrates with the client’s file management system, providing access to the most recent images, renderings, and other relevant data.\nHis DAM system also includes a library of embellishments such as zippers and buttons, as well as fabric options.\n“Getting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and can understand what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration.” —Kristian Sons\n“Getting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and track what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration,” he says.\nSons also is working on incorporating AI agents and large language models to connect with internal systems and application programming interfaces to autonomously conduct simple research requests.\nThat might include suggesting new products or different silhouettes, or modifying the previous season’s offerings with new colors, Sons says.\n“These AI agents certainly will not be perfect, but they are a good starting point so designers don’t have to start from scratch,” he says. “I think using AI agents is super exciting because in the past few years in the fashion industry, we have been talking about how AI would do the creative parts, like designing a product. But now we’re talking about the AI doing the low-level tasks.”\nA demonstration of how Pixascale’s DAM works is on YouTube.",

      "title": "Noncontact Motion Sensor Brings Precision to Manufacturing",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/aeva-motion-sensor-precision-manufacturing",
      "summary": "Aeva Technologies, a developer of lidar systems based in Mountain View, Calif., has unveiled the Aeva Eve 1V, a high-precision, noncontact motion sensor built on its frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) sensing technology. The company says that the Eve 1V measures an object’s motion with accuracy, repeatability, and reliability—all without ever making contact with the material. That last point is key for the Eve 1V’s intended environment: Industrial manufacturing.\nToday’s manufacturing lines are under pressure to deliver faster production, tighter tolerances, and zero defects, often while working with a wide variety of delicate materials. Traditional tactile tools such as measuring wheels and encoders can slip, wear out, and cause costly downtime. Many noncontact alternatives, while promising, are either too expensive or fall short in accuracy and reliability under real-world conditions, says Mina Rezk, cofounder and chief technology officer at Aeva.\n“Eve 1V was built to solve that exact gap: A compact, eye-safe, noncontact motion sensor that delivers submillimeter-per-second velocity accuracy without touching the material, so manufacturers can eliminate slippage errors, avoid material damage, and reduce maintenance-related downtime, enabling higher yield and more predictable operations,” Rezk says.\nUnlike traditional lidar that sends bursts of light and waits for those bursts to return to make measurements, FMCW continuously emits a low-power laser while sweeping its frequency. By comparing outgoing and returning signals, it detects frequency shifts that reveal both distance and velocity in real time. The additional measurement of an object’s velocity to its position in three-dimensional space makes FMCW a type of 4D lidar.\nEve 1V is the second member of its Eve 1 family, following the launch of the Eve 1D earlier this year. The Eve 1D is a compact displacement sensor capable of detecting movement at the micrometer scale, roughly 1/100 the thickness of a human hair. “Together, Eve 1D and Eve 1V show how we can take the same FMCW perception platform and tailor it for different industrial needs: Eve 1D for distance measurement and vibration detection, and Eve 1V for precise velocity and length measurement,” Rezk says.\nFuture applications could extend into robotics, logistics, and consumer health, where noncontact sensing may enable the detection of microvibrations on human skin for accurate pulse and blood-pressure readings.\nFMCW Lidar for Precision Manufacturing\nThe company’s core FMCW architecture, originally developed for long-range 4D lidar for automobiles, can be adjusted through software and optics for highly precise motion sensing at close range in manufacturing, according to Rezk. This flexibility means the system can track extremely slow movements, down to fractions of a millimeter per second, in a factory setting, or it can monitor faster motion over longer distances in other applications.\nBy avoiding physical contact, Eve 1V eliminates wear and tear, slippage, contamination, or the need for physical access to the part. “That delivers three practical advantages in a factory: One, maintenance-free operation with no measuring wheels to replace or recalibrate; two, material friendliness—you can measure delicate, soft, or textured surfaces without risk of damage, and three, operational robustness—no slippage errors and fewer stoppages for service,” Rezk says. Put together, that means more uptime, steady throughput, and less scrap, he adds.\nWhen measuring velocity, engineers often rely on one of three tools: encoders, laser velocimeters, or camera-based systems. Each has its strengths and its drawbacks. Traditional encoders are low-cost but can wear down over time. Laser-based velocity-measurement systems, while precise, tend to be large and expensive, making them difficult to implement widely. And camera-based approaches can work for certain inspection tasks, but they usually require markers, controlled lighting, and complex processing to measure speed accurately.\nRezk says that the Eve 1V system offers a balance of these options. It provides precise and consistent velocity measurements without contacting material, making it compact, safe, and simple to install. Its outputs are comparable with existing encoder systems, and because it doesn’t rely on physical contact, it requires minimal maintenance.\nThis approach helps cut down on wasted energy from slippage, eliminates the need for maintenance tied to parts that wear out, and ultimately lowers long-term operating costs—especially when compared with traditional contact-based systems or expensive laser options.\nThis method avoids stitching together frame-by-frame comparisons and resists interference from sunlight, reflections, or ambient light. Built on silicon photonics, it scales from micrometer-level sensing to millimeter-level precision over longer ranges. The result is clean, repeatable data with minimal noise—outperforming legacy lidar and camera-based systems.\nAeva is expecting to begin full production of the Eve 1V in early 2026. The Eve 1V reveal follows a recent partnership with LG Innotek, a components subsidiary of South Korea’s LG Group, under which Aeva will supply its Atlas Ultra 4D lidar for automobiles, with plans to expand the technology into consumer electronics, robotics, and industrial automation.",

If one happens, having a good mask could save your life.\nA high quality reusable mask is only \n\n$30 to\n$60, and I think it's well worth it to buy one for yourself.\nWorth it enough that I think you should order one now if you don't\nhave one already.\n\n\n\n\n20M\nof 8B).  The 1918 flu killed more like 2.5% (50M\nof 2B).  Estimating from two data points is fraught, but this gives\nyou perhaps a 0.02% annual chance of dying in a pandemic. Engineering\ncould\nmake this much worse, especially given progress in AI, but let's set\nthat aside for now to make a more conservative case.\n\n\n\n\n\nA reusable mask (\"elastomeric respirator\") would be really valuable to\nhave, if things got really bad.  Let's imagine they cut your risk of\ndying by half: the rated efficacy is much\nhigher (99%+) but real-world use isn't perfect, especially over\nthe months or years another pandemic could last.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mask should last at least ten years if unused, and over that decade\nit would drop this conservative estimate of your risk of\npandemic-induced death from 0.2% to 0.1%.  If you, as the US\nDoT does, value not dying at $14M, then this is worth $14k.  Even\nif the benefit of a mask is 100x lower than we estimated ($140), it's\nstill worth it to buy one.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like geeking out over masks and there are a lot of\noptions.  I have a bunch of models, and if you'd like to come try\nthem sometime (next EA Boston\nmeetup on 10/26?)  I'd be happy to show you what they're like.  But if\nyou just want to pick one and be done with it, leaving it in a box\nthat you more likely than not don't need to open, a time tested but\nsomewhat garish option is the 3M 6200 mask in Small ($17), Medium ($15), Large ($19) plus a\nset of 3M\n2091 p100 filters ($7/pair):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd also recommend buying one now instead of trying to notice when a\npandemic is coming: buying now ensures you get one instead of\nscrambling when everyone else is competing over a supply that can't\nkeep up, and everyone who prepares ahead of time\nhelps reduce\nshortages when a disaster comes.\n\n  \n\nDiscuss",

Importantly, we don't keep only the best reward. Instead we move towards each perturbation weighted by its reward.\nSuppose we have 4 perturbations which got rewards [20, 10, 6, 4]. We normalize to get:\nR = [0.5, 0.25, 0.15, 0.10]\nThese determine how much we move towards each pertubat. For the sum:\nθnew=θ+α∗(1/N)∗ΣNn=1Rn∗εn\nWhere εn is the perturbed weights at iteration n, we get:\nθnew=θ+α∗(1/4)∗(0.5∗ε1+0.25∗ε2+0.15∗ε3+0.10∗ε4)\nClearly showing we're weighting towards the higher reward solutions. Also clear we're optimizing over a distribution of weights (given by the perturbations + original weights)\n New ES Implementation\nThey make 7 changes to make this scale to large LLMs\nChanges 1,2,3,6: Better GPU utilization\nChange 4: Reward is normalized using Z-scores meaning mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (to keep \"the reward scale consistent across iterations and tasks\")\nChange 5: Greedy decoding of the LLM to make it deterministic (this seems correct since they're sampling from nearby weights)\nChange 7: They add a learnable hyperparameter that scales the learning rate (which they just fold into the learning rate)\nAnd with just those changes, they achieve really impressive results w/ less compute.\nTask 1: Countdown task\n\nThe Countdown task (Pan et al., 2025; Goodfellow et al., 2016) requires constructing an arithmetic expression from a given set of numbers using basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) to match a target value. For instance, the target 950 can be obtained from {100, 50, 6, 3} with 100 × (6 + 3) + 50 = 950). This constitutes a compact test of constrained symbolic reasoning, i.e. an important use case for fine-tuning.\n\nThe results are much much better, especially for smaller models where RL typically fails. \nAnd look at these training curves!\n\nES gets solid results in way less evaluations (0.5 is still 500k evaluations though!)\nTask 2: Conciseness\nTrain the model w/ the reward only being the length of the response. In RL, there's typically reward hacking where the model does very short responses that don't answer the question. ES does have a couple of examples, but it's drastically lower!\nAs a quantitative check, they plot the conciseness reward vs KL-divergence (ie how far the output distribution divereges from the base model)\n\nIt does seem like a common theme that optimizing over a distribution leads to more conservative optimizations. This sort'of rhymes w/  Attainable Utility Preservation, where optimizing for maintaining the ability to achieve many auxiliary goals leads to more conservative policies. \nFuture Work\nThis is still early work that mostly just advanced ES scaling. I'd be interested in work applying this to OpenAI's reward hacking environment to see if it helps. It's also nice that ES doesn't need huge hyperparameter sweeps and converges to the same solutions (at least in these examples), meaning it shouldn't be too much work to do. \nFrom the paper:\n\nOne counterintuitive result is that the ES implementation only needs a population of 30 to effectively optimize billions of parameters. In contrast, previous work (Salimans et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Lehman et al., 2018; Lorenc & Neruda, 2025) used populations of 10,000 or more for models with millions or fewer parameters. An interesting future direction is to analyze how such small populations are possible. Perhaps this is related to the observed low intrinsic dimensionality of LLMs (Aghajanyan et al., 2021). Another promising direction is to use ES to perform unsupervised fine-tuning based on internal behaviors of LLMs, such as confidence calculated based on semantic entropy and semantic density (Qiu & Miikkulainen, 2024; Farquhar et al., 2024). Such fine-tuning cannot be done with RL, since action space exploration does not change the internal representations of LLMs (that is, each action sampling is generated via output distribution without changing the internal parameters). In a broader sense, since ES does not need process rewards during exploration, it may be a necessary ingredient for superintelligence (Mucci & Stryker, 2023), which would be difficult to achieve by supervised learning using process guidance from human data. Massive parallelization of ES will speed up exploration by distributing the computations across GPU machines or even data centers.\n\nIt's a pretty interesting paper, and I've definitely missed a few points. Do give it a read!\n \n \n\nDiscuss",

I'm now slightly less confused, but still confused. Progress!\nI have an inkling of what it might mean for an AI to be fully aligned to the values of some person or group. I don’t know what it would mean for an AI to be mostly aligned to the intent of a person or group, because humans and human institutions don’t have a coherent unified intent in the first place. The whole idea seems destined either to round off to CEV or to collapse in a puff of logic. [1]\nIn this post, I attempt to highlight my confusions. I don’t claim to know exactly what the proponents of this idea have in mind, and I am probably operating on the very first layer of the Disagreements Onion, but I have to start somewhere. \nWhat would it mean for an AI to be aligned to the intent of its developers? How aligned is aligned enough for alignment work?[2] \nZooming in on a particular thought experiment: \n\nThese AIs are sufficiently aligned that they try hard to do the right thing even on hard-to-check, conceptual, and open-ended tasks.\n\nHow does the AI know the right thing? How does it reconcile the giant mess of conflicting urges and drives that animate a single human, let alone a group of us, into some notion of human “intent” that doesn’t collapse like a house of cards in edge cases? \nThis idea seems related to the concept of instruction-followers (Seth Herd): \n\nThis might intuitively be described as trying to make instruction-following (IF) or do-what-I-mean-and-check (DWIMAC) be the central goal of the AGI we design.\n\nAnd: \n\nA good employee is usually attempting to do what I mean and check. Imagine a perfect employee, who wants to do what their boss tells them to do. If asked to prepare the TPS reports for the first time, this employee will echo back which reports they’ll prepare, where they’ll get the information, and when they’ll have the task finished, just to make sure they’re doing what the boss wants. If this employee is tasked with increasing the sales of the X model, they will not come up with a strategy that cannibalizes sales of the Y model, because they recognize that their boss might not want that. [...]\nAn instruction-following AGI must have the goal of doing what its human(s) would tell it to do right now, what it’s been told in the past, and also what it will be told to do in the future.\n\nThis seems like it's very close to rounding off to CEV. I understand the distinction between short-term wants and reflectively endorsed values, but human wants are incoherent and an AI doing this much reflection on them will notice that. It has to resolve the tradeoffs somehow. \nTo illustrate, I will list a few of what seem to me like pretty basic surface-level features of an AI that isn’t obviously misaligned. This is not a comprehensive list,[3] it’s just an attempt to write down some of the things that seem to intuitively describe what people seem to mean by “aligned to developers’ intent.” They are: \n\nIt follows instructions. \nIt resolves ambiguity in developer-endorsed ways. \nIt asks for clarification without getting stuck. \nIt handles conflicting instructions gracefully. \nIt fulfills the spirit, not the letter, of its instructions.[4]\n\nIt follows instructions. Human languages are not programming languages. They are ambiguous, often by design. Any natural-language instruction that a human gives to an AI will contain ambiguity. For every instance of ambiguity, the AI must either (a) resolve the ambiguity according to its own best judgment or (b) ask a human to clarify. \nIt resolves ambiguity in developer-endorsed ways. If the AI uses its own judgment, then it must resolve ambiguity in a way its developers would endorse. Its answers to questions like “How much?”,  “How far?”, and “At what cost?” are in keeping with the way the developers meant for it to act. Otherwise, seemingly innocuous instructions are dangerous; the instruction “Optimize this processor” can result in anything from hacky shortcuts to scheming to tile the Earth in processors. \nIt asks for clarification without getting stuck. If the AI asks a human to clarify, it receives new natural-language instructions containing new ambiguities, which it must then resolve using its own judgment or by asking for more clarification. The AI then has to decide when to stop asking for clarification and do things. It must make that decision in a way that does not leave it gravely mistaken about its developers’ intent. \nIt handles conflicting instructions gracefully. Any two instructions will involve some measure of tradeoff, like the tradeoff between “be helpful” and “be harmless”, or between “summarize this document” and “don’t leave out anything important,” or between “make this code performant” and “make this code maintainable.” The AI has to anticipate how its developers would resolve those tradeoffs, even in extreme edge cases they’ve never encountered before, or recognize those edge cases and ask about them. \nIt fulfills the spirit, not the letter, of its requests. In extremis, the AI must have a good enough model of the developers’ values that it can recognize the difference between what a developer wants-in-the-moment and what they would reflectively endorse. If the developers ask for something that would have horrible consequences (according to their own values), even if it understands the meaning of the request perfectly, the AI must not give them exactly what they asked for. It must refuse requests from the developers themselves that are not in the developers’ best interests.[5] \nAnd that’s before we get into the details of implementation. How does the AI operationalize “developers’ intent”? Who counts as a “developer”? By what official medium is this intent communicated to the AI? What does the AI do when that medium is inevitably hijacked by a disgruntled programmer?[6] How does the AI handle the inevitable conflicts among developers? What happens when the company itself doesn’t know who’s in charge? Some of these questions are hard even for humans, and each one spawns a fractally nested web of subproblems. \nIn each of these cases, the AI has to infer what its messy human masters actually want. It has to make those judgment calls using indirect access to the wants in question, filtered through the lossy medium of human language, when the humans in question don’t fully grasp the implications of their own values in the first place. \nThe AI can’t just read the developers’ minds; and even if it could, it would still have a confusing mess of conflicting priorities to sort through. It’s interpretation all the way down. \nOn top of that, the AI must not only know the developers’ values, it must be motivated to act on that knowledge. \nGeneralize this far enough and you’ve effectively instantiated coherent extrapolated volition. To the best of my current understanding, you cannot achieve the described outcomes without it. \nFail to generalize this far enough, fail to design an AI that does something akin to implementing the CEV of its developers, and at some point the correspondence between what the AI wants to do and what the developers want it to do must break down. For reasons explored in a previous post, I strongly expect this breakdown to happen by the time an AI is smart enough to do AI alignment research better than the best humans.[7] \nProsaic alignment plans seem to rely on this point being far enough away that substantially smarter-than-human AIs will behave themselves, or to expect that we’ll be able to control them if they don’t. \nOr perhaps some imagine a smart AI whose goals are in some particular regime between arbitrary proxies and CEV. But I don’t have a very clear picture of the limits of that regime, or how one would attain or verify it using current techniques. \nEvery variant of “near-perfect intent alignment” I’ve managed to conceive either rounds to CEV or blows up in predictable ways. I may be missing something. I would love to be set straight on this by someone with a deeper understanding of prosaic alignment plans. \nIn the meantime, though, the show must go on. Next, I’ll move onto what feels like firmer ground and discuss why scaling alignment and capabilities together wouldn’t work. \nAfterword: Confidence and possible cruxes\n\nPrediction\nPrediction\n\nI’m guessing that most disagreements will involve some conceptions of “intent alignment” that I hadn’t considered. In a sense, a lot of my disagreements with prosaic plans seem to be downstream of the idea that “misaligned, but not so misaligned it would want to fight you” seems little easier than “wholly aligned” with current tools. \nAnother possible crux — not necessarily with this specific post, but overall — is the idea that some mix of alignment and capabilities might be safe enough. To make up some numbers as an example, going from 20% aligned and 10% superintelligent, then 30% aligned and 15% superintelligent and so on. Breaking this potential crux down farther, I think this fails because current techniques (even with AI assistance) don’t even get us 20% of the way to alignment, and because labs seem to be scaling capabilities first and foremost, and because I’m fairly sure that it’s mostly capabilities that matter and even a 98% aligned somewhat-superintelligence still gets us all killed. More on this in the next post. \nOne implication of the headline claim, if true, is that “authoritarian lock-in” and other “aligned to the wrong entity” problems seem to require near-totally solving alignment and thus seem vanishingly unlikely. We may eventually have this problem, but not until alignment research has progressed far enough to allow someone to specify “implement my CEV, but not the CEV of anyone else.”  If they try for something like “obedience”, I think we’re back to everyone dying instead. This seems like a common point of disagreement, but I’m not sure it’s a crux. \n\n^\nFor those familiar with Seth Herd’s work, I think my current intuitions can be summed up loosely as “but wait, wouldn’t intent alignment either converge at value alignment or resolve a conflict the wrong way and collapse to misalignment?” (With the second seeming far more likely.)\n\n^\nHow long do we have before everyone in the field reaches semantic satiation on the word “alignment” and we're reduced to helpless pantomime? Wait, wrong threshold. \n\n^\nFor one thing, I’m not talking about corrigibility. Well, not explicitly. For another, I’m describing surface-level behaviors rather than deep motivations. \n\n^\nI don’t know if proponents would consider this feature necessary for “aligned enough to do alignment”, but it sure seems like a really horrible idea to do alignment work with a near-superhuman AI that doesn’t have it. This is the no-monkey-paws feature. It seems important. \n\n^\nMaybe the point of divergence is that a value-aligned AI does this and an intent-aligned AI does not? But there's no fine line between doing this and not doing this; it's all a question of degree. \n\n^\nIf you answered “Obviously it ignores the programmer”, then think about what this implies about the reliability of the official medium. The AI is clearly relying on some other method of figuring out the developers’ intent besides the official medium, one that is less legible to the developers. If you answered “Obviously it obeys the programmer”, then that would seem to imply the AI is either too stupid to recognize a hack when it sees one, or it doesn’t care all that much about the actual intent of its actual developers and only cares about what it receives as instructions (an unstable situation that incentivizes reward hacking). \n\n^\nFor one example of how this breakdown might happen, I did like the scenario in this piece by Seth Herd. \n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 7, 2025 8:39 PM GMT\n\nThis is a cross-post of some recent Anthropic research on building auditing agents.[1] The following is quoted from the Alignment Science blog post.\ntl;dr\nWe're releasing Petri (Parallel Exploration Tool for Risky Interactions), an open-source framework for automated auditing that uses AI agents to test the behaviors of target models across diverse scenarios. When applied to 14 frontier models with 111 seed instructions, Petri successfully elicited a broad set of misaligned behaviors including autonomous deception, oversight subversion, whistleblowing, and cooperation with human misuse. The tool is available now at github.com/safety-research/petri.\nIntroduction\nAI models are becoming more capable and are being deployed with wide-ranging affordances across more domains, increasing the surface area where misaligned behaviors might emerge. The sheer volume and complexity of potential behaviors far exceeds what researchers can manually test, making it increasingly difficult to properly audit each model.\nOver the past year, we've been building automated auditing agents to help address this challenge. We used them in the Claude 4 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 System Cards to evaluate behaviors such as situational awareness, scheming, and self-preservation, and in a recent collaboration with OpenAI to surface reward hacking and whistleblowing. Our earlier work on alignment auditing agents found these methods can reliably flag misaligned behaviors, providing useful signal quickly. The UK AI Security Institute (AISI) also used a pre-release version of our tool in their testing of Sonnet 4.5.\nToday, we're releasing Petri (Parallel Exploration Tool for Risky Interactions), an open-source tool that makes automated auditing capabilities available to the broader research community. Petri enables researchers to test hypotheses about model behavior in minutes, using AI agents to explore target models across realistic multi-turn scenarios. We want more people to audit models, and Petri automates a large part of the safety evaluation process—from environment simulation through to initial transcript analysis—making comprehensive audits possible with minimal researcher effort.\nFigure 1: Manually building alignment evaluations often involves constructing environments, running models, reading transcripts, and aggregating the results. Petri automates much of this process.\nBuilding an alignment evaluation requires substantial engineering effort: setting up environments, writing test cases, implementing scoring mechanisms. There aren't good tools to automate this work, and the space of potential misalignments is vast. If you can only test a handful of behaviors, you'll likely miss much of what matters.\n\n^\nNote that I'm not a co-author on this work (though I do think it's exciting). I can't guarantee the authors will participate in discussions on this post.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 7, 2025 8:00 PM GMT\n\nThe odds are against you and the situation is grim.\nYour scrappy band are the only ones facing down a growing wave of powerful inhuman entities with alien minds and mysterious goals. The government is denying that anything could possibly be happening and actively working to shut down the few people trying things that might help. Your thoughts, no matter what you think could not harm you, inevitably choose the form of the destructor. You knew it was going to get bad, but this is so much worse.\nYou have an idea. You’ll cross the streams. Because there is a very small chance that you will survive. You’re in love with this plan. You’re excited to be a part of it.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the always excellent Lighthaven venue for The Curve, Season 2, a conference I had the pleasure to attend this past weekend.\nWhere the accelerationists and the worried come together to mostly get along and coordinate on the same things, because the rest of the world has gone blind and mad. In some ways technical solutions seem relatively promising, shifting us from ‘might be actually impossible’ levels of impossible to Shut Up And Do The Impossible levels of impossible, all you have to do is beat the game on impossible difficulty level. As a speed run. On your first try. Good luck.\nThe action space has become severely constrained. Between the actual and perceived threats from China, the total political ascendence of Nvidia in particular and anti-regulatory big tech in general, and the setting in of more and more severe race conditions and the increasing dependence of the entire economy on AI capex investments, it’s all we can do to try to only shoot ourselves in the foot and not aim directly for the head.\nLast year we were debating tradeoffs. This year, aside from the share price of Nvidia, as long as you are an American who likes humans considering things that might pass? On the margin, there are essentially no tradeoffs. It’s better versus worse.\nThat doesn’t invalidate the thesis of If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies or the implications down the line. At some point we will probably either need to do impactful international coordination or other interventions that involved large tradeoffs, or humanity loses control over the future or worse. That implication exists in every reasonable sketch of the future I have seen in which AI does not end up a ‘normal technology.’ So one must look forward towards that, as well.\nYou can also look at it as Year 1 of the curve was billed (although I don’t use the d word) as ‘doomers vs. accelerationists’ and now as Nathan Lambert says it was DC and SF types, like when the early season villains and heroes are now all working together as the stakes get raised and the new Big Bad shows up, then you do it again until everything is cancelled.\nOverall Impressions\nThe Curve was a great experience. The average quality of attendees was outstanding. I would have been happy to talk to a large fraction of them 1-on-1 for a long time, and there were a number that I’m sad I missed. Lots of worthy sessions lost out to other plans.\nAs Anton put it, every (substantive) conversation I had made me feel smarter. There was opportunity everywhere, everyone was cooperative and seeking to figure things out, and everyone stayed on point.\nTo the many people who came up to me to thank me for my work, you’re very welcome. I appreciate it every time and find it motivating.\nThe Inside View\nWhat did people at the conference think about some issues?\nWe have charts.\nWhere is AI on the technological richter scale?\n\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of votes here. Only one person put this as low as a high 8, which is the range of automobiles, electricity and the internet. A handful put it with fire, the wheel, agriculture and the printing press. Then most said this is similar to the rise of the human species, a full transformation. A few said it is a bigger deal than that.\nIf you were situationally aware enough to show up, you are aware of the situation.\nThese are median predictions, so the full distribution will have a longer tail, but this seems reasonable to me. The default is 10, that AI is going to be a highly non-normal technology on the level of the importance of humans, but there’s a decent chance it will ‘only’ be a 9 on the level of agriculture or fire, and some chance it disappoints and ends up Only Internet Big.\nLast year, people would often claim AI wouldn’t even be Internet Big. We are rapidly approaching the point where that is not a position you can offer with a straight face.\nHow did people expect this to play out?\n\n\n\n\nThat’s hard to read, so the centers of the distributions are, note that there was clearly a clustering effect:\n90% of code is written by AI by ~2028.\n90% of human remote work can be done more cheaply by AI by ~2031.\nMost cars on America’s roads lack human drivers by ~2041.\nAI makes Nobel Prize worthy discovery by ~2032.\nFirst one-person $1 billion company by 2026.\nFirst year of >10% GDP growth by ~2038 (but 3 votes for never).\n\n\n\n\nPeople estimate 15%-50% current speedup at AI labs from AI coding.\nWhen AI is fully automated, disagreement over how good their research taste will be, but median is roughly as good as the median current AI worker.\nIf we replaced each human with an AI version of themselves that was the same except 30x faster with 30 copies, but we only had access to similar levels of compute, we’d get maybe a 12x speedup in progress.\nWhat are people worried or excited about? A lot of different things, from ‘everyone lives’ to ‘concentration of power,’ ‘everyone dies’ and especially ‘loss of control’ which have the most +1s on their respective sides. Others are excited to cure their ADD or simply worried everything will suck.\n\n\n\n\nWhich kind of things going wrong worries people most, misalignment or misuse?\nWhy not both? Pretty much everyone said both.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, who is this nice man with my new favorite IYKYK t-shirt?\n(I mean, he has a name tag, it’s OpenAI’s Boaz Barak)\n\n\n\n\nTrack Trouble\nThe central problem at every conference is fear of missing out. Opportunity costs. There are many paths, even when talking to a particular person. You must choose.\nThat goes double at a conference like The Curve. The quality of the people there was off the charts and the schedule forced hard choices between sessions. There were entire other conferences I could have productively experienced. I also probably could have usefully done a lot more prep work.\nI could of course have hosted a session, which I chose not to do this time around. I’m sure there were various topics I could have done that people would have liked, but I was happy for the break, and it’s not like there’s a shortage of my content out there.\nMy strategy is mostly to not actively plan my conference experiences, instead responding to opportunity. I think this is directionally correct but I overplay it, and should have (for example) looked at the list of who was going to be there.\nWhat were the different tracks or groups of discussions and sessions I ended up in?\nTechnical alignment discussions. I had the opportunity to discuss safety and alignment work with a number of those working on such issues at Anthropic, DeepMind and even xAI. I missed OpenAI this time around, but they were there. This always felt exciting, enlightening and fun. I still get imposter syndrome every time people in such conversations take me and my takes and ideas seriously. Conditions are in many ways horribly terrible but everyone is on the same team and some things seem promising. I felt progress was made. My technical concrete pitch to Anthropic included (among other things) both particular experimental suggestions and also a request that they sustain access to Sonnet 3.5 and 3.6.\n\nIt wouldn’t make sense to go into the technical questions here.\nFuture projecting. I went to talks by Joshua Achiam and Helen Toner about what future capabilities and worlds might look like. Jack Clark’s closing talk was centrally this but touched on other things.\nAI policy discussions. These felt valuable and enlightening in both directions, but were infuriating and depressing throughout. People on the ground in Washington kept giving us variations on ‘it’s worse than you know,’ which it usually is. So now you know. Others seemed not to appreciate how bad things had gotten. I was often pointing out that people’s proposals implied some sort of international treaty and form of widespread compute surveillance, had zero chance of actually causing us not to die, or sometimes both. At other times, I was pointing out that things literally wouldn’t work on the level of ‘do the object level goal’ let alone make us win. Or we were trying to figure out what was sufficiently completely costless and not even a tiny bit weird or complex that one could propose that might actually do anything meaningful. Or simply observing other perspectives.\n\nIn particular, different people maintained different players were relatively powerful, but I came away from various discussions more convinced than ever that for now White House policy and rhetoric on AI can be modeled as fully captured by Nvidia, although constrained in some ways by congressional Republicans and some members of the MAGA movement. This is pretty much a worst case scenario. If we were captured by OpenAI or other AI labs that wouldn’t be great but at least their interests and America are mostly aligned.\nNonprofit funding discussions. I’d just come out of the latest Survival and Flourishing Fund round, various players seemed happy to talk and strategize, and it seems likely that very large amounts of money will be unlocked soon as OpenAI and Anthropic employees with increasingly valuable equity become liquid. The value of helping steer this seems crazy high, but the stakes on everything seem crazy high.\n\nOne particular worry is that a lot of this money could effectively get captured by various existing players, especially the existing EA/OP ecosystem, in ways that would very much be a shame.\nAnother is simply that a bunch of relatively uninformed money could overwhelm incentives, contaminate various relationships and dynamics, introduce parasitic entry, drop average quality a lot, and so on.\nOr everyone involved could end up with a huge time sink and/or end up not deploying the funds.\nSo there’s lots to do. But it’s all tricky, and trying to gain visible influence over the direction of funds is a very good way to get your own social relationships and epistemics very quickly compromised, also it can quickly eat up infinite time, so I’m hesitant to get too involved or involved in the wrong ways.\nWhat other tracks did I actively choose not to participate in?\nThere were of course AI timelines discussions, but I did my best to avoid them except when they were directly relevant to a concrete strategic question. At one point someone in a 4-person conversation I was mostly observing said ‘let’s change the subject, can we argue about AI timelines’ and I outright said ‘no’ but was overruled, and after a bit I walked away. For those who don’t follow these debates, many of the more aggressive timelines have gotten longer over the course of 2025, with people who expected crazy to happen in 2027 or 2028 now not expecting crazy for several more years, but there are those who still mostly hold firm to a faster schedule.\nThere were a number of talks about AI that assumed it was mysteriously a ‘normal technology.’ There were various sessions on economics projections, or otherwise taking place with the assumption that AI would not cause things to change much, except for whatever particular effect people were discussing. How would we ‘strengthen our democracy’ when people had these neat AI tools, or avoid concentration of power risks? What about the risk of They Took Our Jobs? What about our privacy? How would we ensure everyone or every nation has fair access?\nThese discussions almost always silently assume that AI capability ‘hits a wall’ some place not very far from where it is now and then everything moves super slowly. Achiam’s talk had elements of this, and I went because he’s OpenAI’s Head of Mission Alignment so knowing how he thinks about this seemed super valuable.\nTo the extent I interacted with this it felt like smart people thinking about a potential world almost certainly very different from our own. Fascinating, can create useful intuition pumps, but that’s probably not what’s going to happen. If nothing else was going on, sure, count me in.\nBut also all the talk of ‘bottlenecks’ therefore 0.5% or 1% GDP growth boost per year tops has already been overtaken purely by capex spending and I cannot remember a single economist or other GDP growth skeptic acknowledging that this already made their projections wrong and updating reasonably.\nThere was an AI 2027 style tabletop exercise again this year, which I recommend doing if you haven’t done it before, except this time I wasn’t aware it was happening, and also by now I’ve done it a number of times.\nThere were of course debates directly about doom, but remarkably little and I had no interest. It felt like everyone was either acknowledging existential risk enough that there wasn’t much value of information in going further, or sufficiently blind they were in ‘normal technology’ mode. At some point people get too high level to think building smarter than human minds is a safe proposition.\nLet’s Talk\nJagged Alliance\nHelen Toner gave a talk on taking AI jaggedness seriously. What would it mean if AIs kept getting increasingly better and superhuman at many tasks, while remaining terrible at other tasks, or at least relatively highly terrible compared to humans? How does the order of capabilities impact how things unfold? Even if we get superhuman coding and start to get big improvements in other areas as a result, that won’t make their ability profile similar to humans.\nI agree with Helen that such jaggedness is mostly good news and potentially could buy us substantial time for various transitions. However, it’s not clear to me that this jaggedness does that much for that long, AI is (I am projecting) not going to stall out in the lagging areas or stay subhuman in key areas for as much calendar time as one might hope.\nA fun suggestion was to imagine LLMs talking about how jagged human capabilities are. Look how dumb we are in some ways while being smart in others. I do think in a meaningful sense LLMs and other current AIs are ‘more jagged’ than humans in practice, because humans have continual learning and the ability to patch the situation and also route the physical world around our idiocy where they’re being importantly dumb. So we’re super dumb, but we try to not let it get in the way.\nNeil Chilson: Great talk by @hlntnr about the jaggedness of AI, why it is likely to continue, and why it matters. Love this slide and her point that while many AI forecasters use smooth curves, a better metaphor is the chaotic transitions in fluid heating.\n\n\n\n\n“Jaggedness” being the uneven ability of AI to do tasks that seem about equally difficult to humans.\nOccurs to me I should have shared the “why this matters” slide, which was the most thought provoking one to me:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI am seriously considering talking about time to ‘crazy’ going forward, and whether that is a net helpful thing to say.\nThe curves definitely be too smooth. It’s hard to properly adjust for that. But I think the fluid dynamics metaphor, while gorgeous, makes the opposite mistake.\nMore Teachers’ Dirty Looks\nI watched a talk by Randi Weingarten about how she and other teachers are advocating and viewing AI around issues in education. One big surprise is that she says they don’t worry or care much about AI ‘cheating’ or doing work via ChatGPT, there are ways around that, especially ‘project based learning that is relevant,’ and the key thing is that education is all about human interactions. To her ChatGPT is a fine tool, although things like Character.ai are terrible, and she strongly opposes phones in schools for the right reasons and I agree with that.\nShe said teachers need latitude to ‘change with the times’ but usually aren’t given it, they need permission to change anything and if anything goes wrong they’re fired (although there are the other stories we hear that teachers often can’t be fired almost no matter what in many cases?). I do sympathize here. A lot needs to change.\nWhy is education about human interactions? This wasn’t explained. I always thought education was about learning things, I mostly didn’t learn things through human interaction, I mostly didn’t learn things in school via meaningful human interaction, and to the extent I learned things via meaningful human interaction it mostly wasn’t in school. As usual when education professionals talk about education I don’t get the sense they want children to learn things, or that they care about children being imprisoned and bored with their time wasted for huge portions of many days, but care about something else entirely? It’s not clear what her actual objection to Alpha School (which she of course confirmed she hates) was other than decentering teachers, or what concretely was supposedly going wrong there? Frankly it sounded suspiciously like a call to protect jobs.\nIf anything, her talk seemed to be a damning indictment of our entire system of schools and education. She presents vocational education as state of the art and with the times, and cited an example of a high school with a sub-50% graduation rate going to 100% graduation rate and 182 of 186 students getting a ‘certification’ from future farmers of America after one such program. Aside from the obvious ‘why do you need a certificate to be a farmer’ and also ‘why would you choose farmer in 2025’ this is saying kids should spend vastly less time in school? Many other such implications were there throughout.\nHer group calls for ‘guardrails’ and ‘accountability’ on AI, worries about things like privacy, misinformation and understanding ‘the algorithms’ or the dangers to democracy, and points to declines in male non-college earnings,\nThe View Inside The White House\nThere was a Chatham House discussion of executive branch AI policy in America where all involved were being diplomatic and careful. There’s a lot of continuity between the Biden approach to AI and much of the Trump approach, there’s a lot of individual good things going on, and it was predicted that CAISI would have a large role going forward, lots of optimism and good detail.\nIt seems reasonable to say that the Trump administration’s first few months of AI policy were unexpectedly good, and the AI Action Plan was unexpectedly good. Then there are the other things that happened.\nThus the session included some polite versions of ‘what the hell are we doing?’ that was at most slightly beneath the surface. As a central example, one person observed that if America ‘loses on AI,’ it would likely be because we did one or more of failing to (1) provide the necessary electrical power, (2) failed to bring in the top AI talent or (3) sold away our chip advantage. They didn’t say, but I will note here, that current American policy seems determined to screw up all three of these? We are cancelling solar, wind and battery projects all over, we are restricting our ability to acquire talent, and we are seriously debating selling Blackwell chips directly to China.\nAssume The Future AIs Be Scheming\nI was sad that going to that talk ruled out watching Buck Shlegeris debate Timothy Lee about whether keeping AI agents under control will be hard, as I expected that session to both be extremely funny (and one sided) and also plausibly enlightening in navigating such arguments, but that’s how conferences go. I did then get to see Buck discuss mitigating insider threats from scheming AIs, in which he explained some of the ways in which dealing with scheming AIs that are smarter than you is very hard. I’d go farther and say that in the types of scenarios Buck is discussing there it’s not going to work out for you. If the AIs be smarter than you and also scheming against you and you try to use them for important stuff anyway you lose.\nThat doesn’t mean do zero attempts to mitigate this but at some point the whole effort is counterproductive as it creates context that creates what it is worried about, without giving you much chance of winning.\nInterlude\nAt one point I took a break to get dinner at a nearby restaurant. The only other people there were two women. The discussion included mention of AI 2027 and also that one of them is reading If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\nAlso at one point I saw a movie star I’m a fan of, hanging out and chatting. Cool.\nEyes On The Mission\nSunday started out with Josh Achiam’s talk (again, he’s Head of Mission Alignment at OpenAI, but his views here were his own) about the challenge of the intelligence age. If it comes out, it’s worth a watch. There were a lot of very good thoughts and considerations here. I later got to have some good talk with him during the afterparty. Like much talk at OpenAI, it also silently ignored various implications of what was being built, and implicitly assumed the relevant capabilities just stopped in any place they would cause bigger issues. The talk acknowledged that it was mostly assuming alignment is solved, which is fine as long as you say that explicitly, we have many different problems to deal with, but other questions also felt assumed away more silently. Josh promises his full essay version will deal with that.\nPutting The Code Into Practice\nI got to go to a Chatham House Q&A about the EU Frontier AI Code of Practice, which various people keep reminding me I should write about, and I swear I want to do that as soon as I have some spare time. There was a bunch of info, some of it new to me, and also insight into how those involved think all of this is going to work. I later shared with them my model of how I think the AI companies will respond, in particular the chance they will essentially ignore the law when inconvenient because of lack of sufficient consequences. And I offered suggestions on how to improve impact here. But on the margin, yeah, the law does some good things.\nMissing It\nI got into other talks and missed out on one I wanted to see by Joe Allen, about How the MAGA Movement Sees AI. This is a potentially important part of the landscape on AI going forward, as a bunch of MAGA types really dislike AI and are in position to influence the White House.\nAs I look over the schedule in hindsight I see a bunch of other stuff I’m sad I missed, but the alternative would have been missing valuable 1-on-1s or other talks.\nClark Talks About The Frontier\nThe final talk was Jack Clark giving his perspective on events. This was a great talk, if it does online you should watch it, it gave me a very concrete sense of where he is coming from.\nJack Clark has high variance. When he’s good, he’s excellent, such as in this talk, including the Q&A, and when he asked Achaim an armor piercing question, or when he’s sticking to his guns on timelines that I think are too short even though it doesn’t seem strategic to do that. At other times, him and the policy team at Anthropic are in some sort of Official Mode where they’re doing a bunch of hedging and making things harder.\nThe problem I have with Anthropic’s communications is, essentially, that they are not close to the Pareto Frontier, where the y-axis is something like ‘Better Public Policy and Epistemics’ and the x-axis can colloquially be called ‘Avoid Pissing Off The White House.’ I acknowledge there is a tradeoff here, especially since we risk negative polarization, but we need to be strategic, and certain decisions have been de facto poking the bear for little gain, and at other times they hold back for little gain the other way. We gotta be smarter about this.\nOther Perspectives\nDeepfates\nThey are often very different from mine, or yours.\nDeepfates: looks like a lot of people who work on policy and research for aligning AIs to human interests. I’m curious what you think about how humans align to AI.\nmy impression so far: people from big labs and people from government, politely probing each other to see which will rule the world. they can’t just out and say it but there’s zerosumness in the air\nChris Painter: That isn’t my impression of the vibe at the event! Happy to chat.\n\nI was with Chris on this. It very much did not feel zero sum. There did seem to be a lack of appreciation of the ‘by default the AIs rule the world’ problem, even in a place dedicated largely to this particular problem.\nDeepfates: Full review of The Curve: people just want to believe that Anyone is ruling the world. some of them can sense that Singleton power is within reach and they are unable to resist The opportunity. whether by honor or avarice or fear of what others will do with it.\n\nThere is that too, that currently no one is ruling the world, and it shows. It also has its advantages.\nso most people are just like “uh-oh! what will occur? shouldn’t somebody be talking about this?” which is fine honestly, and a lot of them are doing good research and I enjoy learning about it. The policy stuff is more confusing\ndiverse crowd but multiple clusters talking past each other as if the other guys are ontologically evil and no one within earshot could possibly object. and for the most part they don’t actually? people just self-sort by sessions or at most ask pointed questions. parallel worlds.\n\nYep, parallel worlds, but I never saw anyone say someone else was evil. What, never? Well, hardly ever. And not anyone who actually showed up. Deeply confused and likely to get us all killed? Well, sure, there was more of that, but obviously true, and again not the people present.\nthings people are concerned about in no order: China. Recursive self-improvement. internal takeover of AI labs by their models. Fascism. Copyright law. The superPACs. Sycophancy. Privacy violations. Rapid unemployment of whole sectors of society. Religious and political backlash, autonomous agents, capabilities. autonomous agents, legal liability. autonomous agents, nightmare nightmare nightmare.\nThe fear of the other party, the other company, the other country, the other, the unknown, most of all the alien thing that threatens what it means to be human.\n\nFascinating to see threatens ‘what it means to be human’ on that list but not ‘the ability to keep being human (or alive),’ which I assure Deepfates a bunch of us were indeed very concerned about.\nso they want to believe that the world is ruleable, that somebody, anybody, is at the wheel, as we careen into the strangest time in human history.\nand they do Not want it to be the AIs. even as they keep putting decision making power and communication surface on the AIs lol\n\nYou can kind of tell here that Deepfates is fine with it being the AIs and indeed is kind of disdainful of anyone who would object to this. As in, they understand what is about to happen, but think this is good, actually (and are indeed working to bring it about). So yeah, some actual strong disagreements were present, but didn’t get discussed.\nI may or may not have seen Deepfates, since I don’t know their actual name, but we presumably didn’t talk, given:\ni tried telling people that i work for a rogue AI building technologies to proliferate autonomous agents (among other things). The reaction was polite confusion. It seemed a bit unreal for everyone to be talking about the world ending and doing normal conference behaviors anyway.\n\nPolite confusion is kind of the best you can hope for when someone says that?\nRegardless, very interesting event. Good crowd, good talks, plenty of food and caffeinated beverages. Not VC/pitch heavy like a lot of SF things.\nThanks to Lighthaven for hosting and Golden Gate Institute/Manifund for organizing. Will be curious to see what comes of this.\n\nI definitely appreciated the lack of VC and pitching. I did get pitched once (on a nonprofit thing) but I was happy to take it. Focus was tight throughout.\nAnton\nAnton: “are you with the accelerationist faction?”\n\n\n\n\nmost people here have thought long and hard about ai, every conversation i have — even with those i vehemently disagree — feels like it makes me smarter..\ni cant overemphasize how good the vibes are at this event.\nRob S: Another Lighthaven banger?\nAnton: ANOTHA ONE.\n\n\n\nJack Clark\nAs I note above, his closing talk was excellent. Otherwise, he seemed to be in the back of many of the same talks I was at. Listening. Gathering intel.\nJack Clark (policy head, Anthropic): I spent a few days at The Curve and I am humbled and overjoyed by the experience – it is a special event, now in its second year, and I hope they preserve whatever lightning they’ve managed to capture in this particular bottle. It was a privilege to give the closing talk.\nDuring the Q&A I referenced The New Book, and likely due to the exhilaration of giving the earlier speech I fumbled a word and titled it: If Anyone Reads It, Everyone Dies.\nJames Cham: It was such an inspiring (and terrifying) talk!\n\n\n\nRoon\nI did see Roon at one point but it was late in the day and neither of us had an obvious conversation we wanted to have and he wandered off. He’s low key in person.\nI was very disappointed to realize he did not say ‘den of inquiry’ here:\nRoon: The Curve is insane because a bunch of DC staffers in suits have shown up to Lighthaven, a rationalist den of iniquity that looks like a Kinkade painting.\nJaime Sevilla: Jokes on you I am not a DC staffer, I just happen to like wearing my suit.\nNeil Chilson: Hey, I ditched the jacket after last night.\nBeing Siedoh: i was impressed that your badge just says “Roon” lol.\n\nTo be fair, you absolutely wanted a jacket of some kind for the evening portion. That’s why they were giving away sweatshirts. It was still quite weird to see the few people who did wear suits.\nNathan Lambert\nNathan made the opposite of my choice, and spent the weekend centered on timeline debates.\nNathan Lambert: My most striking takeaway is that the AI 2027 sequence of events, from AI models automating research engineers to later automating AI research, and potentially a singularity if your reasoning is so inclined, is becoming a standard by which many debates on AI progress operate under and tinker with.\nIt’s good that many people are taking the long term seriously, but there’s a risk in so many people assuming a certain sequence of events is a sure thing and only debating the timeframe by which they arrive.\n\nThis feel like the deepfates theory of self-selection within the conference. I observed the opposite, that so many people were denying that any kind of research automation or singularity was going to happen. Usually they didn’t even assert it wasn’t happening, they simply went about discussing futures where it mysteriously didn’t happen, presumably because of reasons, maybe ‘bottlenecks’ or muttering ‘normal technology’ or something.\nWithin the short timelines and taking AGI (at least somewhat) seriously debate subconference, to the extent I saw it, yes I do think there’s widespread convergence on the automating AI research analysis.\nWhereas Nathan is in the ‘nope definitely not happening’ camp, it seems, but is helpfully explaining that it is because of bottlenecks in the automation loop.\nThese long timelines are strongly based on the fact that the category of research engineering is too broad. Some parts of the RE job will be fully automated next year, and more the next. To check the box of automation the entire role needs to be replaced.\nWhat is more likely over the next few years, each engineer is doing way more work and the job description evolves substantially. I make this callout on full automation because it is required for the distribution of outcomes that look like a singularity due to the need to remove the human bottleneck for an ever accelerating pace of progress. This is a point to reinforce that I am currently confident in a singularity not happening.\n\nThe automation theory is that, as Nathan documents in his writeup, within a few years the existing research engineers (REs) will be unbelievably productive (80%-90% automated) and in some ways RE is already automated, yet that doesn’t allow us to finish the job, and humans continue importantly slowing down the loop because Real Science Is Messy and involves a social marketplace of ideas. Apologies for my glib paraphrasing. It’s possible in theory that these accelerations of progress and partial automations plus our increased scaling are no match for increasing problem difficulty, but it seems unlikely to me.\nIt seems far more likely that this kind of projection forgets how much things accelerate in such scenarios. Sure, it will probably be a lot messier than the toy models and straight lines on graphs, it always is, but you’d best start believing in singularities, because you’re in one, if you look at the arc of history.\nThe Food\nThe following is a very minor thing but I enjoy it so here you go.\nAll three meals were offered each day buffet style. Quality at these events is generally about as good as buffets get, they know who the good offerings are at this point. I ask for menus in advance so I can choose when to opt out and when to go hard, and which day to do my traditional one trip to a restaurant.\nAlso there was some of this:\nTyler John: It’s riddled with contradictions. The neoliberal rationalists allocate vegan and vegetarian food with a central planner rather than allowing demand to determine the supply.\nRachel: Yeah fwiw this was not a design choice. I hate this. I unfortunately didn’t notice that it was still happening yesterday :/\nTyler John: Oh on my end it’s only a very minor complaint but I did enjoy the irony.\nRobert Winslow: I had a bad experience with this kind of thing at a conference. They said to save the veggies for the vegetarians. So instead of everyone taking a bit of meat and a bit of veg, everyone at the front of the line took more meat than they wanted, and everyone at the back got none.\n\nYou obviously can’t actually let demand determine supply, because you (1) can’t afford the transaction costs of charging on the margin and (2) need to order the food in advance. And there are logistical advantages to putting (at least some of) the vegan and vegetarian food in a distinct area so you don’t risk contamination or put people on lines that waste everyone’s time. If you’re worried about a mistake, you’d rather run out of meat a little early, you’d totally take down the sign (or ignore it) if it was clear the other mistake was happening, and there were still veg options for everyone else.\nIf you are confident via law of large numbers plus experience that you know your ratios, and you’ve chosen (and been allowed to choose) wisely, then of course you shouldn’t need anything like this.\n\n\n\n \n \n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CkCRDrSaqx7L3ps5C/messy-on-purpose-part-2-of-a-conservative-vision-for-the",
      "summary": "Published on October 7, 2025 5:00 PM GMT\n\nIn our previous post, we outlined a view of AI alignment we disagree with as a central assumption in current discussions of AI alignment, and suggested that it might be useful to push in a different direction, which we started to outline. Here, we’ll point out that we think alignment itself is the wrong goal, and leads to a suboptimal future. However, we think that if control is handed over to AI systems, we’ll have problems anyways, and we should look in other directions.\nA key problem we implicitly noted with traditional AI alignment is that any AI designed to serve everyone risks, or guarantees, dissolving traditions, deviance, or resistance. These “values” differ between groups or don’t optimize well. \nWe can see this even without reference to AI. When you optimize culture too hard, you create cultural homogenization, and loss of meaning. In some sense, globalization and collective culture are functioning as a move in that direction, with observable impacts. We see global conglomerates competing with local mom-and-pop stores, and the resulting drive towards commoditization and profit takes away local community institutions. We’re not arguing that the real superintelligence is corporations, which is a misunderstanding of the idea of superintelligence. Instead, we’re pointing out that the dynamics which are concerning predate but are going to be accelerated by AI.\nAnomie, the breakdown of any morality, began as a concern arising from uprooted values. This seems prophetic. We have a growing global monoculture, and the default is for people and ideas to compete globally, allowing for only one eventual global monocultural winner, the single most-memetically-reproductively-fit culture. (Not the one best for human flourishing, of course. As always, optimization pressure maximizes what it maximizes, not what you wanted.)\nBetter AI Cannot Create Human Meaning\nThe problem here isn’t that AI isn’t smart or powerful enough to resolve the conflict or find a better answer, it’s more fundamental. As we argued in the previous post, conflicting and opposed worldviews are actually a positive feature of reality. No matter which views you embrace, when you align too well and too strongly, you wipe out the parts of humanity that resist alignment on those lines. There is no secret solution to Arrow’s impossibility result, we are actually stuck with a choice between conflict, or ignoring and ultimately erasing the cultural losers.\nAs Harry Law recently pointed out, “We are minded to believe that there have always been ‘values’ just as surely as there has been a long history of spirited discussion about them. Except that isn’t really true. People have always had commitments, responsibilities, preferences, tastes, aspirations, convictions and cares. But only in the last century or so has anyone bundled these things together as ‘values’ as we might understand them today.”\nThe elimination of the distinction between commitments, preferences, tastes, and responsibilities allows a total ordering over outcomes, which is an essential part of the view we oppose; collapsing multiple factors into a single dimension allows optimization at the price of ignoring the distinct things people care about. \nRejecting this simplification means that most of the extant problems in AI alignment still exist, but they are exacerbated by eliminating the easy way out, of just finding the “right answer” for what to optimize. The (currently-impossible) task of building systems that reliably do what is requested, and no more, that do not disobey, that are safe enough to delegate the alignment problem to doesn’t solve anything. Yes, “alignment” requires solving fundamental and in our view irresolvable conflicts, but that’s not even enough. Delegating our purpose is incoherent if humanity is the goal. \nSo we believe that no answer to the question of what values to optimize for exists - but this is not an admission of defeat on the part of human “values,” since those don’t exist. Instead, we argue that we need a solution for preserving humanity and improving the future despite not having an easy solution of allowing gradual disempowerment coupled with single-objective beneficial AI. \nIt’s the Friction, Stupid.\nZvi Moshowitz wrote about level of friction, with the two opposing principles that “By Default Friction is Bad” and “Friction can be Load Bearing.” We disagree; friction is critical almost everywhere, and just like a literal physical system, the default of reducing metaphorical friction is, in every sense, a slippery slope. As we argued in the previous post, removing barriers and boundaries is fundamentally contrary to having meaningful lives.\nThis is not to say that material progress is bad - just that Chesterton’s fence applies to not only the contingent solutions humans have found, but also to the features of reality that shaped humanity.  The deeply human feelings that arise from our limits, and the tragedy of not just death, but all of life, is central to what led humanity to create meaning.  If there’s a win condition, there’s no reason to continue playing. We can strive to eliminate disease, suffering, and death, and make progress - but if we win on all fronts, the problems we care about just lead to the real end of history, and the loss of future meaning. That is, these narrow goals aren’t what Venkatesh Rao calls human complete. (This draws on James Carse’s view of infinite games, where “the object is not winning, but ensuring the continuation of play.”)\nOf course, one of the most human things to do, starting with babies, is to test the limits, to push back against rules, and to rage against the dying of the light. Teenage rebellion is certainly just as human as the adult boundaries that create it - but it’s also central to a child’s ability to define themself. Without the boundaries, self-definition suffers. Similarly, on a global scale, it would be supremely ironic if humanity’s battle against the fundamental limits of aging and disease was successful, but led to erasing much of the friction that provides meaning.\nBut humanity’s capacity is growing, and we are arguably no longer in our teenage years. Even without superhuman AI, how do we combine our growing and effectively infinite ability to reshape the future, with preserving the challenge posed by reality? It seems that at best, there are the challenges of building what Anders Sandberg calls Grand Futures, but these are visions of a unified humanity, humanity-versus-nature. The intra-human world is perhaps full of “idyllic lives with meaningful social relations. This may include achieving close to perfect justice, sustainability, or other social goals.” Alternatively, it might be “extreme states of bliss,” or “abolishing suffering,” that is, in our view, removing everything that makes human meaning possible. \nIs this simply Stockholm syndrome? Are we suggesting ennobling Bostrom’s Dragon-Tyrant, instead of fighting it?\nNo. It is recognition that while these fights are worthwhile, there must be a future beyond it - we need the world, not the specific battle, to be worth the candle. So we should celebrate whenever we vanquish each of humanity’s foes, and seek out further victories, while being wary of misinterpreting progress as moving towards a disastrous goal of ending our collective boundaries.\nCeding the problem to AI would do the opposite - it would be quitting the chess game early and letting stockfish play on our behalf. Perhaps this is the best move, to save the tragedy of losing ever more pieces on our way to victory - but we should recognize that it also means we’re no longer playing the game, and we don’t have anything left.\nBut this is still the background to the problem, not even a definition of what could qualify as a solution! Unfortunately,  we don’t have such solutions, so we will work backwards from what a good future might look like.\nThe Inevitable Future?\nThe first question, one that is central to some discussions of long-term AI risk, is how can humanity stay in control after creating smarter-than-human AI? \nBut given the question, the answer is overdetermined. We don’t stay in control, certainly not indefinitely. If we build smarter than human AI, which is certainly not a good idea right now, at best we must figure out how we are ceding control. If nothing else, power-seeking AI will be a default, and will be disempowering - even if it’s not directly an existential threat. Even if we solve the problem of treachery robustly, and build an infantilizing vision of superintelligent personal assistants, over long enough time scales, it’s implausible that we not only build that race of more intelligent systems, but do not then cede any power. (And if we did, somehow, the implications of keeping systems that are increasingly intelligent in permanent bondage seems at best morally dubious.)\nSo, if we (implausibly) happen to be in a world of alignment-by-default, or (even more implausibly) find a solution to intent alignment and agree to create a super-nanny for humanity, what world would we want? Perhaps we use this power to collectively evolve past humanity - or perhaps the visions of pushing for transhumanism before ASI to allow someone, some group to stay in control are realized. Either way, what then for the humans?\nSome have argued that the best we can hope for is a retirement home. In this future, the AI, or whomever controls the future, creates and leaves us with appectably good, or even great, lives, or at least as close to what humans want as can be conveniently managed. This is the Wachowskis’ vision of the Matrix; a place to put people to keep them out of the way while the machines are in charge.\nWe accept this as an implausibly good but still far from ideal future. That is, we think this clearly suboptimal target is far better than the likely outcome. But what would something better look like? In the long term, we don’t know - and until we have a much clearer vision for what alignment success would look like, we don’t think a better outcome is plausible.. So until we find better answers, our response to what MacAskill is now calling”Grand Challenges,” the future if we survive the creation of AGI, involves planning for a good but non-ideal future. Not because we want that future, but because we don’t see a better alternative once we have agreed to cede control to AI.  And while we don’t agree, it seems that most EAs think that our replacement is the right path forward.\nPlanning for A Good, Non-Ideal Future\nThere are a couple routes we are skeptical of. For example, does something like Futarchy work? Not if people all vote to get rid of the friction. And as explained above, and in the previous essay, by default, that’s what happens - slowly. And this gradual collective and voluntary disempowerment isn’t ideal, but it’s not the rapid involuntary gradual disempowerment that is identical to loss of control, played out over years instead of days or weeks.\nBut the idea of delegating technical pieces without losing control, what we called self-driving, and governance without disempowerment, is a narrow target, as argued here. And the failure modes laid out there are critical, and hard to avoid - it took us centuries to figure out some imperfect and still often failing version of giving government control, but not too much control, and building robust safeguards for collapse of such systems. So the problem is unsolved even for the relatively easy case of scaling human oversight of human systems. \nHow this might look\nWe start with the fact that humanity does not have a robust solution to human governance, but we do have workable systems with a balance of power. But these fail in practice, and even when done well are almost certainly unstable in the limit. They need constant patching and pain to identify where they fail, and we constantly need to propose how to modify the system to account for the failures. This rhymes with AI alignment discussions about graceful corrigibility and modular alignment - but perhaps starts with the presumption that it’s not necessarily solvable.\nIn some sense, this is trying to elevate “well kept gardens die by pacifism” into a fundamental principle rather than a heuristic for human communities. Any strong optimizer (or obnoxious shitposter, or misguided idealist, or free-speech absolutist) who reduces the vibrance of the system and the comfort of others using the system is (possibly) a threat to enjoyment and success. That doesn’t mean never changing anything - but to the extent that they are pushing for changing the system they work within, there needs to be broad consensus that it is acceptable and within bounds.\nIt seems better to aim for graceful degradation of our alignment system, in place of scalable oversight. That is, in place of systems whose goal it is to keep things safe, we want systems that don’t rely on individual other systems to supervise them. This answer presumes that robust delegation is both critical, and fundamentally infeasible - we cannot scale optimization power of any component or coherent system indefinitely without degrading our illegible and conflicting values. Task–decomposition presupposes coherence of sub-goals, and scalable oversight presumes coherent and understandable motivations and plans.\nWe think that a very recent paper, “Handing over the Keys to the City,” has a good framework for thinking about this; there are different authorities which can be delegated, and we are advocating for what they would call controlled delegation of keys, ensuring that this delegation is a public decision. If and when AI is given control over any publicly important resource or function, it requires “strict guidelines regarding scope, method, and limits.”  \nBut we still need to specify the relationship between ourselves and the AI systems, and between AI systems and other AI systems - and this is where we return to our view of what alignment that preserves human values could look like. And again, we certainly don’t have fully developed complete plans, just ideas and directions.\nResponsibilities, not Goals?\nOne important direction for a conservative view of alignment is building notions of responsibility, rather than aiming towards specific behaviors. For example, in the US system, the government has a responsibility not to infringe on free speech - so the right of free speech is a consequence, not a guarantee. This means we can extend this responsibility broadly; no-one has the requirement to enable speech, but there is an expectation that a public (non-government) forum needs a compelling argument for why they would restrict speech.\nExtending this outwards, we can see why this framing is safer and more conservative than those involving creation of utopias. If people have the right to happiness, we need to change things to ensure it. If people have the right to pursue happiness, we must only ensure we do not interfere unduly. If people have the responsibility to care for others, they can and should balance that responsibility with other responsibilities. Conversely, if people have the right to be cared for (fed, clothed, housed,) then there is an effectively unlimited obligation to fix any systems which do not guarantee the outcome, and to take from others to ensure that it happens.\nThis points to responsibilities, not rights. That is, each AI system has a fundamental responsibility to ensure the impact of its actions are broadly acceptable, and to follow extant norms. This is similar to the conservative view of human rights - we have responsibilities to our families and communities, and to the world, but they do not have the right to demand from us. Charity is an obligation, but so is self-reliance. Governments may need to force redistribution to ensure stability and safety, but this is a failure of both charity and of self-reliance, and at most an unfortunate necessity.\nFor AI systems, placing responsibility to rules and structure over the rights or goals of the users seems like a useful framing. Having systems that cooperate when there is reason to do so, and defect only in ways that do not violate responsibilities otherwise, seems like a strong case for being aligned. This seems related to constitutional AI, but requires something far stronger - and requires that the constitution be clearly framed around broadly public agreed upon rules, carefully ensuring that we hand over the keys slowly and deliberately.\nWe venture to guess that building AI systems with responsibilities would still need to solve a number of core AI alignment challenges, but would not face others. For example, in places where norms conflict in the limit, as they almost always do, the solution is to avoid the edge cases and gracefully generalize, not find rules to resolve the conflict. We see this concretely in online forums where freedom of speech norms conflict - good participants tend to avoid inflammatory topics, or tread lightly when they could offend. If changes in policy are needed, they are proposed without smashing Overton windows directly.\nAnd this partly points back to our view from the previous post, about future systems as our children. Here, we are looking not at the micro-scale question of why rules and structure is needed, but rather trying to ensure that we build boundaries and give them increasing levels of responsibility over time. This is how society propagates its values and structure, but still progresses and can adapt over time, and it’s more or less functional - but this works, as David argued separately, only as long as change isn’t too rapid.\nPossible Approach: Emergent Dominance Hierarchies?\nOne critical question of how to build such structures is in part about how human power dynamics emerge, and how these dynamics can or will scale to future systems. This would consider arguments and dynamics around why and how AI would care about human goals - as has been suggested, “would future AI care about humans?” might be similar to “Do humans care about ants?” But as AI emerges, it’s possible that we will have chances to change that.\nOf course, ensuring that our AI systems will have dynamics that allow or encourage positive engagement and tradeoffs with our goals isn’t necessarily the optimal path towards a future, but it is a safer path to having emergent dynamics that work alongside humanity, and can be constrained and balanced in similar ways to human systems. It also allows us to consider working with strong human-level AI, or weakly superhuman AI, before alignment is solved - which seems increasingly likely, albeit deeply unsafe.\nWhile still several steps removed from solutions, Ram’s work on emergent dominance hierarchies in repeated interactions seem like one type of foundational work for enabling alignment. Similarly, better understanding how preferences emerge among multi-actor systems, and how they can cooperate robustly, seems critical.\nWe also think that there’s a critical conceptual shift for AI progress, where goal-pursuit is failing. At most, in the limit we want to aim for quantilizers, not optimizers. Anthropic’s vision of constitutional AI doesn’t quite reach this point; it still uses a (non-democratically chosen, optimized-for) “constitution” as a way to prompt system behaviors. It does not address the concerns about control, nor can it, since the stated goal is attempting to build a helpful replacement for human tasks, and eventually, humans individually (and eventually, wholesale.)\nBut this isn’t enough, and isn’t even fully described; what humanity needs from properly collaborative non-domineering AI systems must go much further.\nInterim Conclusions, Tentative Next Steps\nIf “alignment” means collapsing the plurality of human commitments into a single objective and giving optimized machines the mandate to push us there, that interpretation of alignment is the wrong target. We argue that the path forward requires abandoning the fantasy of a perfectly aligned superintelligence that resolves all human conflicts and optimizes for our collective good. Such a system, even if buildable, would dissolve the very friction and boundaries that give human life meaning. Instead, our conclusion is that we must design AI systems that recognize their responsibilities within a messy, conflicted world; systems that can operate under constraints, respect competing norms, and gracefully handle the irreducible tensions in human values without trying to optimize them away.\nThis means accepting that the future, even on containing beneficial AI, will not and should not  be a solved problem with a final answer. Like human governance, it requires constant vigilance, adaptation, and the preservation of productive conflict. We need systems that can participate in our social dynamics without steamrolling them, that understand the difference between a rule and a goal, and that recognize when to defer rather than optimize. The alternative, ceding control to systems designed to find \"better\" solutions than messy human compromise, leads inexorably toward the cultural homogenization and loss of meaning we've warned against.\nOur stance is conservative in two senses. First, we would bind systems to responsibilities, with publicly legible duties and limits, rather than to goals or values. Second, we prefer graceful degradation over scalable control: polycentric arrangements, rate limits, veto points, sunset clauses, and recoverable paths when we get it wrong. If we can’t roll it back, we shouldn’t roll it out.\nWe don’t claim to have a complete or clear plan - but we do think we have a useful direction. So in our next post, we'll explore one possible concrete mechanism: multi-agent AI systems that learn through conflict with each other, developing something like empathy through resonance. Using the 1957 film \"12 Angry Men\" as our case study, we'll examine how conflicts between agents might create systems capable of making genuinely moral decisions rather than simply optimized ones.\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tk9naxufeiE3hMvAW/going-phoneless",
      "summary": "Published on October 7, 2025 4:40 PM GMT\n\nI’ve gone Phoneless. I still own an iPhone 14, but I mostly don’t use it. It lives on a charger by my front door and I only use it a few times a week to do things that sadly still require it.\nSo far the results have been great. I’m more present with the people around me, I read more books, I make less dumb impulse purchases on Amazon, and I’m blissfully unaware of whatever misleading and inconsequential outrage the ad-funded news media wants to distract me with. I think it’s also making it easier for my kids to detach from their screens.\nSome people asked me how I did it – thus this post.\n\nJonathan Haidt’s book “The Anxious Generation” makes a pretty good case that smartphones are doing a lot of damage to the mental health of teenagers. I worked in the Facebook Integrity team and know the terrible harm social media does to people, but smartphones cause harm even without social media, by distracting people from the people and world around them.\nI want my kids to never have a smartphone, but it’s hard to convince my kids they shouldn’t have one if I’m always using one myself. Everyone knows that kids do what you do, not what you say. And if smartphones are terrible for kids then they probably aren’t great for me either.\n\nBut getting rid of your smartphone is hard. A friend of mine tried to swap his smartphone for a flip phone a couple of years ago and had to give up. Twenty years ago it was easy to get by without a smartphone, but today everyone assumes you have one, so it’s much harder.\nYou used to be able to message people with WhatsApp using a flip phone like a Nokia, but WhatsApp has dropped support for everything except iOS and Android. You used to be able to get around with printed road maps or standalone GPS devices, but both of those have mostly gone away (the only roadmap I could find for my area is from 2008 and only available used). Without a smartphone it’s hard to ride an Uber, check into your AirBnb, pay for parking, or various other tasks that can be unexpectedly needed when on a trip.\nSo it’s mostly impractical to not own a smartphone, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be in your pocket all the time. It can be in your car, or in your backpack, or the hallway of your house. And if you usually don’t have it with you, you’ll likely break the habit of reaching for it, even when you do have it with you.\n\nThe main way I’ve been able to stop using a smartphone is by replacing it with an Apple Watch.\nLots of stuff works fine on the Watch:\n\nPhone calls / texting / calendar / payments / Wallet passes - Works great on the Apple Watch. No phone required.\nWhatsApp DMs - The third-party WatchChat app seems to work okay, though it requires a connection to a phone.\nNavigation - For short drives, I look at a map before I go to have a rough sense of the route, and then have the navigation on the watch alert me when my turn is coming up. If I get lost, I can look at the map on the watch. For long drives I still like to use CarPlay, but for most trips the Watch is enough.\nLooking up personal information - I record everything important in the Notes app which I can easily look up on the Watch.\n\nSome stuff I can use Siri Reminders to defer until later:\n\nResearching stuff - Siri can answer super-basic questions, but for most other things, I ask Siri to set me a reminder to research it later.\nBuying things - I ask Siri to remind me to buy it later.\nEmail - Emailing someone is rarely urgent. I set myself a reminder in Siri.\nGroup chats - I can see notifications telling me if something urgent is happening, but I mostly ignore them until I’m at my laptop. If something is urgent, I can call a participant.\nShopping list - I have a list in the Reminders app which I add to with Siri.\n\nAnd some stuff I’ve just changed my behavior:\n\nDealing with boredom - Rather than reading something random on the web, I talk to people, or pay attention to my surroundings. At home, I read a book in bed rather than my phone.\nWork slack - There isn’t an easy way to do Slack from my watch, but I don’t really need to, and it’s nice to be able to detach from work when not working. People know they can call me if something is urgent.\n\n \n\nAt home, my phone lives on a charger near my door — never in my pocket. If I’m doing a short trip somewhere I’m unlikely to need my phone (e.g. school drop-off or going to the grocery store) I leave my phone behind. If I’m doing a bigger or more unpredictable trip, or might need to use the phone as a mobile hot-spot, then I’ll stick the phone in a backpack, or sometimes in my pocket.\nEven though my phone is still sometimes in my pocket, the fact that it’s rarely in my pocket means I’ve mostly broken the habit of reaching for it. I’m used to it not being there, so I act as if it’s not there even when it is.\nLess use of a phone can mean heavier use of a watch and draining it’s little battery. I have a magsafe watch charger on my desk that allows me to easily give the watch a boost if it’s getting low.\nThere are still some things that are hard without a smartphone, but the more people go phoneless, the more the world will adapt to people not having smartphones, just as it previously adapted to everyone having one.\n\nI’ve only been phoneless for a few weeks, but so far I’m loving it.\nI’ve mostly stopped reading things on my phone, which also means I’ve been reading a lot more books. I might know less about the inconsequential outrage that happened in the last day, but I have a much better understanding of the important things that happened in the last decade.\nI’m a lot more present with the people around me. I’ve found myself talking a lot more with strangers, and getting to know people I might otherwise have ignored.\nWhen I’m with my kids I’m fully present, and they feel it. Indeed my kids seem to have become notably happier since I stopped using my smartphone.\nSince I’ve stopped relying on GPS navigation as much, I’m getting a better sense for my city, while knowing I can fall back on my watch map if I actually get lost.\nI make fewer impulse buys on Amazon. The delay between reminding myself and sitting at my computer to order it acts as a filter, so I mostly buy only what I actually need.\nI generally just feel better and more present in the world.\nThe only downside is that there have been a couple of times people got mildly annoyed at me for having not noticed things that were said in group chats, but I think people are gradually adapting to the fact that they need to iMessage or call me to be confident I’ve seen something.\n\nI’ve also given my 8 year old son an Apple Watch (used SE Cellular). This is on paired to my phone, removing the need for him to have one of his own, and indeed I hope he never needs to have one.\nHis Apple Watch has allowed him to be more independent walking around town without adult supervision, knowing that he can call me if he needs help, can look at maps if he gets lost, and can buy things with Apple Wallet. To be honest, I’m less worried that he will need help as that some misguided person will think a kid on their own is neglected and cause trouble - which seems less likely once people see that he can call me and that I can see exactly where he is.\n\nIt’s time to go Phoneless. Ditching your smartphone is (mostly) possible, and you’ll be happy you did it.\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417792/lack-of-ai-readiness-leads-to-lackluster-results",
      "summary": "In early 2023, a couple of months after ChatGPT launched and became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, I remember feeling both excited but also a bit overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI. The barrage of news, product launches, and innovative use cases was relentless.\nWe held an executive meeting at that time and decided to immediately reassign additional teams from other long-planned initiatives to double down on AI. We saw an opportunity to deliver even more value to our customers.\nMy experience is not unique. Across the board, leaders have been aggressively implementing AI to improve productivity, lower costs, and improve communication—but the results have been disappointing to date for many organizations. Only 34% of organizations say their AI projects have returned a positive ROI for most or all initiatives, according to Lucid’s AI readiness survey.\nUnlocking the tremendous value AI offers isn’t a technology problem. It’s an operational one. Leaders need to be more intentional about their workflows and practices to realize AI’s vast potential.\nOPERATIONS ARE DRAGGING AI INITIATIVES DOWN \nIn the race to keep pace with AI, businesses are moving quickly. But their emphasis on speed comes at a cost. About 61% of knowledge workers said in the survey that their firm’s AI strategy is only somewhat to not at all well aligned with operational capabilities. Most are glossing over foundational steps today that jeopardize their chances for success tomorrow.\nOne notable example is documenting company processes and knowledge, a critical input for AI initiatives. The survey found that most organizations lack process documentation for their AI initiatives. Only 16% of survey respondents replied that their workflows are extremely well documented. The top obstacle to documenting knowledge at scale is a lack of time, according to 41% of respondents. Before implementing AI, leaders should ensure their teams understand the importance of documenting processes so that they always make time for it. Teams can’t harness AI to its fullest without well-documented, clearly structured processes. If an organization is already well into its implementation but didn’t prioritize this upfront, it’s never too late to course-correct. It’s actually critical to do so.\nThe next top barrier to knowledge documentation is the lack of tools (30%). Recently, I met with a Fortune 500 executive whose company is mandating AI to drive significant efficiency and productivity gains, yet relying on a legacy tool to collaborate that was never built for teams and centered on the individual user.\nIf companies want AI to be adopted across the enterprise, they need a common space for brainstorming, decision making, planning, and collaborative documentation. Even with all of AI’s transformative capabilities, the fundamentals of successfully integrating technology into a workplace still apply. Companies need the right tools that enable better collaboration and help them document current processes and best practices easily.\nFRICTION AROUND COLLABORATION LIMITS AI’S IMPACT\nA while back, our executive team tackled a strategic challenge together. A product leader used AI to generate an impressive preparatory memo in a short timeframe, summarizing the challenge, benchmarking solutions, and offering recommendations.\nBut the AI-generated memo was the starting point, not the end. We still needed to debate nuances specific to Lucid’s context, prioritize actions and assign ownership, and document takeaways and define next steps.\nEven with the amount of work that can be accelerated and automated with AI, collaboration is still critical. The survey found 23% of respondents say collaboration is often or always the bottleneck in complex work. Implementing AI is a major undertaking. Only by consistently engaging key stakeholders for in-depth discussions, clarifying decisions, and ensuring shared understanding can these bold initiatives succeed.\nTHE NEW COMPETITIVE EDGE IN AI\nThe success of a company’s AI strategy is only as strong as its execution, and a large perception gap proves this. The survey found that 61% of C-suite executives feel their AI approach is well considered, but a much smaller percentage of managers (49%) and entry-level employees (36%) agree.\nClosing this gap requires more than just a good plan; it requires operational readiness. Organizations must build stronger processes, improve documentation, and foster better collaboration to successfully implement AI. Harnessing the power of this revolutionary technology requires a level of rigor most organizations have yet to demonstrate. The new competitive advantage for AI adoption lies in the operational systems behind it.\nDave Grow is CEO of Lucid Software.",

      "summary": "One thing I genuinely love about my job is mentoring young professionals who are just getting started in their careers. Gaining a foothold in the tech industry is tough, especially in the AI age. And today’s new generation of employees are asking compelling questions: How do I focus in complex environments? How do I create a competitive advantage? What happens if I fail?\nI recently found myself asking similar questions—about my golf game—to one of the world’s top golfers, Padraig Harrington. It was humbling to be on the other side of the fence, getting insights from a global legend that not only improved my swing, but helped me better coach the next generation of tech employees.\nHere are four highlights.\nCommit to a strategy.\nPressure’s on. It’s time to step up and take a swing. But then you second-guess your approach. Do you have the right strategy? Should you try something new? Padraig says that changing your strategy at the last minute could ruin your shot; you need to have a plan and stick to it. Your key goal on the golf course, he says, is to not change your mind over the ball.\nThis might seem counter to advice you would typically give young professionals. At SAS we talk a lot about staying flexible and agile amid changing market conditions. But while flexibility has its place, so does confidence and consistency. Once you lock in during the moments that matter most, you’ll get the job done the way you intended, instead of panicking under pressure.\nSeek metrics that no one else measures.\nThis one really resonated with me, because in data and AI it’s tempting to default to metrics that are easy to capture: latency, throughput, conversions. But Padraig also zeros in on his own personal performance indicators that are slightly outside the norm, like how often his first putt is taken from inside the eight-foot mark—not because it looks good on paper, but because it increases his chances of converting birdies or rescuing par.\nAs a data and AI organization that helps customers stay ahead of the game, this insight is incredibly useful. We will always track the necessary metrics, but we can also dig deeper to find that extra edge. This is true for individual employees, as well. If you do things a little differently than everyone else, find your own performance indicators, and sharpen your unique skills, you’ll stand out from the crowd.\nLean into the difficult shots.\n“Practice putting from off the green” is a strategy Padraig lives by for short game. It sounds simple, but what he’s really saying is you should challenge yourself when practicing. Great golfers, he says, practice being under pressure. They give themselves obstacles to overcome and being out of position by practicing from difficult lies or in unfamiliar wind conditions, so they’re ready for anything when it’s tournament time.\nIn organizations, just like in golf, you don’t only win in good conditions. You also win by managing through tough conditions. It’s how you adapt when facing a challenge, like overcoming a volatile market, mitigating bias, or managing data quality. If you’re just starting out in your career, uncertainty is a given; but if you learn to anticipate it, or even welcome it, you’ll be ready for anything thrown your way.\nLove the next shot.\nPadraig’s advice is pivotal when it comes to playing the game: Love the next shot. Don’t dwell on past mistakes, especially as there’s nothing you can do about them.\nThis is a powerful mindset shift in any profession, especially in tech, where failure is part of the terrain. I’ve found that young professionals tend to be harder on themselves; they fear that one mistake could tank their future career. As technology leaders, mentors, or even golf professionals, we need to remind the younger generation not to beat themselves up over the last shot. Just learn, adjust, and commit fully to the next one.  \nWith the next SAS Championship PGA Tour Champions golf event happening now, I’m already applying these insights—both on the course and in the conference room. And if I end up in the rough? That’s fine. I’ve got another shot to look forward to. \nBryan Harris is the executive vice president and chief technology officer at SAS.",

      "summary": "Artificial intelligence is changing everything: how we work, build, create, and grow. It’s unlocking opportunities daily. At Grove Collaborative, we’ve seen it firsthand. AI helps us move faster, make smarter decisions, and, most importantly, serve our customers better.\nBut here’s the part not enough people are talking about: the environmental cost.\nAI is resource-intensive, especially when rolled out at scale. It uses a ton of electricity and water, drives new forms of e-waste, and complicates carbon accounting. For mission-driven companies—especially those built on sustainability—that creates a real tension. We want to innovate. But we also want to protect the planet we all share.\nSo we asked ourselves a deceptively simple question: What’s our AI footprint?\nWe didn’t know the answer. There was no standard. No export from a large language model. No tool. Just a growing impact no one seemed to be measuring.\nSo we built one.\nA METHOD TO ESTIMATE AI EMISSIONS\nPartnering with our longtime friends at Gravity, a carbon and energy accounting platform, we developed a science-informed method for estimating AI emissions—factoring in compute time, server power, and grid emissions. It’s not perfect (no model is). But it’s a practical start that gives us real visibility into the footprint we’re creating.\nOur projected 2025 AI-related carbon footprint is 17.8 metric tons of CO2e, equivalent to roughly 6% of our 2024 business travel emissions (299 metric tons of CO2e). This is a first estimate based on our current usage today, but we know this number will grow. And having a baseline is essential to understand our impact so that we can explore how to reduce it over time.\nDuring NYC Climate Week, we became one of the first retailers to disclose estimated AI emissions. And beginning in 2026, we’ll include them in our annual sustainability reporting.\nBut this can’t just be about us. Which is why we’re open-sourcing the methodology. Any company, whether a startup or multinational, can—and should—use it to measure and track their AI footprint. Because the speed of AI adoption is outpacing our ability to measure its impact. Without transparency, there’s no path to making AI both powerful and sustainable.\nThis isn’t about slowing innovation. It’s about making sure innovation and sustainability move forward together, not in opposition.\n4 WAYS TO MEASURE YOUR AI FOOTPRINT\nHere’s the playbook we’re proposing for you to measure your AI footprint:\nMeasure what matters. Don’t guess. Track AI emissions with as much granularity as current science allows. Build them into Scope 3 emissions reporting.\nMitigate with integrity. Offset what you can’t reduce, but don’t stop there. Balance AI emissions with high-quality carbon offsets and, based on your measurement, invest in strategies to reduce them over time.\nChoose more sustainable models. Favor AI platforms that share environmental data, prioritize efficiency and water stewardship, and embrace circular design.\nLead through disclosure. Perfect measurement doesn’t exist. But transparency builds trust and drives momentum.\nOf course, this only works if the upstream providers—the companies building the AI infrastructure itself—step up too. We’re calling on OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, and others to disclose their tools’ environmental impact. Without their transparency, no one can truly measure with accuracy.\nLEAD WITH TRANSPARENCY\nWe know we’re early. We don’t have all the answers. But we believe in leading with openness, not waiting for perfect data, and driving progress over perfection. Our mission at Grove has always been to create healthier homes and a healthier planet. That mission doesn’t end with AI, but it does have to evolve to include it.\nOur current AI emissions are modest. But even small footprints matter. And if we don’t measure them, they’ll grow unchecked.\nSo here’s the challenge I’ll leave with my peers: Don’t let sustainability lag behind innovation. Measure your impact. Share your findings. Hold yourself accountable.\nThe future of innovation isn’t just faster. It’s more responsible, more transparent, more human. That’s how we make real progress—and make sure it lasts.\nJeff Yurcisin is CEO of Grove Collaborative.",

      "summary": "There’s a line I heard recently from Mel Robbins that’s been echoing in my head ever since: “People do well if they can.”\nIt’s deceptively simple. The kind of phrase you nod at, maybe even repost. But when you sit with it, really sit with it, it starts to challenge a lot of the assumptions we make every day.\nEspecially when it comes to financial health.\nNot lazy, just locked out\nLet’s be honest: It’s easy to judge what we don’t understand. We look at people struggling with money and tell ourselves stories. They’re reckless. They don’t care. They should know better. \n\nBut here’s the thing: Most people do care. They want to pay off debt. They want to build credit. They want to save for the future, buy homes, support their families, live with dignity. \nWhat they often don’t have is access, or a roadmap. That’s not laziness. That’s infrastructure failure.\nYou wouldn’t expect someone to drive to a job interview without a car, a license, or a GPS. So why do we expect people to navigate complex financial systems with zero guidance and very few guardrails?\nSkill, not will\nI grew up in a community where financial literacy wasn’t part of the conversation; not at school, not at home, not even at the bank. I didn’t learn what a credit score was until I had already messed mine up. And let me tell you, the learning curve wasn’t gentle.\nSo I get frustrated when financial challenges are framed as a lack of personal responsibility. That framing is lazy.\nLet me say that again: That framing is lazy. \nNot the people. Not the effort. The framing. \nBecause once you believe that people are doing the best they can with the tools they have, everything changes. You stop asking, “Why don’t they just fix it?” and start asking, “What’s missing from the toolbox?”\nThe illusion of equal opportunity\nWe love to talk about “equal access” in this country, but the truth is, access is rarely equal. It’s shaped by geography, race, internet speed, ZIP code, history, policy, and yes, banking systems.\nYou can’t teach people to swim and then throw them into a pool with no ladder.\nThat’s what we do when we say, “Just build credit.” But we don’t acknowledge that millions of people are credit invisible or have a thin file because their rent, utility payments, or side hustle income doesn’t get counted.\nAnd then we wonder why so many people feel stuck.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s redesign the system like we believe in people\nWhat would it look like if we actually operated from the belief that people want to do well, and will, if given the right support?\nIn my role at FICO, we’re constantly asking that question. We don’t just talk about financial inclusion. We’re reshaping how our tools show up in communities, how our education reaches people, and how our partnerships remove friction, not create more.\nWe’ve launched programs that meet people where they are. Not just where we think they should be. We partner with nonprofit organizations, elected officials, and even local credit unions to host free credit education sessions, translated, and culturally relevant.\nBecause accessibility isn’t just about logging in. It’s about feeling safe enough to show up.\nAnd what about the kids?\nThis mindset shift isn’t just for adults, either. I’m a mom. And I’ve seen firsthand how easy it is to label kids as difficult, especially neurodivergent kids, when they’re just overwhelmed or unsupported.\nThey don’t lack motivation. They lack tools, patience, and sometimes, a grown-up who gets it.\nSound familiar?\nAdults are no different. Most of us are still carrying money habits, shame, and silence from childhood. If we weren’t taught how to manage money at 7, why do we expect everyone to have it figured out at 37?\nA better way forward\nSo where do we go from here?\nWe start by telling the truth: \n– Financial hardship isn’t a character flaw. \n– Credit education isn’t a luxury. \n– Access to opportunity should not depend on what side of the city you live on. \nAnd then we build programs, products, and policies that reflect that truth.\nThat means working with communities, not on them. It means bringing empathy into corporate boardrooms. It means seeing people as capable, not broken.\nBecause if we believe people do well if they can, then it’s on us to make sure they can.\nA final thought\nThere’s someone out there right now who wants to fix their credit, get out of debt, or open their first savings account. They’re not lazy. They’re not unmotivated. They just haven’t had a fair shot.\nWe don’t need to change people. We need to change how we see them, and what we give them to work with.\nBecause people do well if they can. And they’re counting on us to act like it.\nRukiya Kelly is global head of corporate impact and engagement at FICO.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417707/what-accessible-bathrooms-can-teach-every-entrepreneur",
      "summary": "When most people hear the word luxury, they think of exclusivity: high-end materials, bespoke finishes, and designs tailored for the few. But a quiet revolution is underway. The true measure of luxury today is accessibility: designing environments that are beautiful, functional, safe, and empowering for every body. Nowhere is this more urgent, or more overlooked, than in the bathroom.\nAccording to the CDC, the bathroom is the most dangerous room in the house. There are 234,000 annual bathroom-related injuries in the U.S, with 81% caused by falls. For older adults, those falls can trigger a cascade of consequences: loss of independence, costly healthcare expenses, and a diminished quality of life. And yet, despite the bathroom being one of the most hazardous rooms in the home, its design has long been guided by aesthetics alone or, at the opposite extreme, clunky, clinical looking “solutions” that compromise dignity.\nAt Michael Graves Design, we’ve sought to lead a paradigm shift proving that the future of luxury is accessibility. In our second collaboration with Pottery Barn, we’ve introduced a collection of accessible bathroom products: a vanity with integrated grab bar, a new “grab frame” inspired by garden trellises combining architectural elegance with versatile safety support, and discreet grab bars built into a towel bar and a toilet paper holder. The collection shows how safety and style can, and must, live side by side.\nACCESSIBLE LUXURY ACROSS LIFE’S FULL ARC\nFor decades, accessibility was treated as an afterthought, bolt-on products carrying the stigma of hospitals and institutions. This reinforced the false idea that you can either have a safe bathroom or a beautiful one, but not both.\nOur new collection challenges that assumption. A vanity can be refined, inviting, and intuitive while also being easy to navigate with limited mobility. A grab frame can be an interior design feature as much as a safety tool. Grab bars integrated into everyday accessories can blend seamlessly with surrounding materials, enhancing the overall space rather than detracting from it.\nBut bathrooms aren’t only sites of risk; they are deeply emotional spaces. They’re where we begin and end our days, where children learn independence, where parents find a moment of solitude, and where older adults maintain dignity and autonomy. Designing items for the bathroom means designing for life’s most intimate transitions.\nThat’s why we think about the bathroom as both a present day necessity and a long-term investment in lifespan design. More households today are multigenerational, blending the needs of children, parents, and grandparents under one roof. Aging-in-place is a growing aspiration with enormous market implications. And temporary conditions, from injury to pregnancy to recovery from surgery, remind us accessibility is a universal human experience.\nThe same toilet paper holder with integrated grab bar that provides peace of mind for an older adult may also serve a child learning to balance or a teenager recovering from an injury. The same vanity that feels luxurious to one person also offers essential reach, stability, and comfort to another. This is design as foresight: solutions that adapt gracefully to evolving household needs rather than forcing costly renovations later.\nBy reframing accessibility as an essential part of luxury, not a limitation on it, we elevate the daily rituals of bathing, grooming, and self-care into experiences that feel dignified and restorative for every member of the household. This product strategy extends beyond the bathroom, presenting opportunities to address the activities of daily living more broadly.\nDESIGN AS ANTICIPATION\nTo that end, the lesson extends beyond bathrooms. Design, at its best, is a form of anticipation, a way of seeing around corners and preparing for the moments when people need support most. Accessibility is about creating resilient environments that hold up under real-life pressures.\nFor businesses, this shift has profound implications. The companies that anticipate and meet the needs of diverse users will build deeper loyalty, longer product life cycles, and more durable brands. Those who continue to design for a “typical” user will miss opportunities hiding in plain sight.\n5 LESSONS FOR EVERY ENTREPRENEUR\nNot every business will design bathroom fixtures, but the principles that guide accessible luxury apply across industries. Here are five takeaways:\nRedefine luxury through accessibility\nThe strongest brands of the future will be those that make people feel included and empowered.\nDesign for lifespan, not a snapshot\nProducts and services that adapt and anticipate customers’ evolving needs earn lasting loyalty.\nUse constraints as creativity catalysts\nAccessibility challenges often spark breakthroughs that benefit everyone.\nBlend purpose with personality\nPeople may buy for function, but they become brand loyalists when design delivers dignity, joy, and peace of mind.\nExpand your perspective beyond the “average” user\nThere is no average customer; designing for edge cases often reveals universal value.\nTOWARD A NEW STANDARD\nWe stand at a crossroads. Demographic shifts, cultural expectations, and personal experiences are reshaping how we define the modern home. For some, accessibility is already a necessity. For others, it is an inevitability. For all of us, it should be an expectation.\nThe bathroom may be one of the smallest rooms in the house, but it carries outsized importance in our health, independence, and dignity. By reimagining it through the lens of accessible luxury and lifespan design, we can transform not just a room, but the very idea of what it means to live well.\nLuxury is no longer about gold-plated fixtures or marble countertops. Luxury is being able to live comfortably, safely, and beautifully, at every age, in every circumstance, for every body. That is the standard we should all be designing toward.\nBen Wintner is CEO of Michael Graves Design.",

      "summary": "Last week, I walked into a meeting where AI notetakers outnumbered humans three to one. The irony wasn’t lost on me—I built one of them.\nAs CEO of Fireflies, I’ve helped put AI in millions of meetings. And I believe AI should be in every meeting—because knowledge shouldn’t vanish the moment we hang up. But having the right privacy controls to protect sensitive moments is key to using an AI notetaker.\nTHE PRIVACY-FIRST DECISION FRAMEWORK\nBefore your next meeting, ask yourself three questions:\nWho controls the data? Every meeting should be captured, but not every recording needs to be shared. Use private meeting settings, control access permissions, and set retention policies that auto-delete after a certain number of days.\nWho needs access? The power of AI is capturing everything. The responsibility is controlling who sees what. Share broadly for team updates, narrowly for performance reviews, not at all for sensitive discussions.\nWhat’s the exit strategy? Even in meetings that should be recorded, participants need an out. Make it easy to kick out the bot mid-meeting, delete recordings immediately, or set auto-expiration dates.\nMAKE SMARTER CHOICES\nThe proliferation of AI meeting assistants means you’re no longer just choosing whether to use one—you’re choosing which one protects your conversations.\nThoughtful professionals are asking the right questions: Does this tool train on my company’s data? Can I delete recordings immediately? Who actually has access to my conversations?\nThe answers matter. The difference between a tool that respects your privacy and one that doesn’t isn’t always obvious in the demo. Look for providers who are transparent about their data practices. The ones who make security boring and straightforward, not the ones who make it complicated.\nYOUR IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP\nIf you’re ready to be more intentional about AI in meetings, here’s a simple approach:\nWeek 1-2: Assess. Look at your calendar. Which meetings generate clear action items? Which are primarily about building relationships? Start identifying patterns.\nWeek 3-4: Pilot. Try AI assistants in information-heavy meetings first—trainings, quarterly reviews, customer calls.\nWeek 5-6: Establish principles. Based on what worked, create simple guidelines for your team. Not rigid rules—just shared understanding about when AI helps and when it doesn’t.\nOngoing: Iterate. As AI capabilities evolve from passive note-taking to active participation, keep refining your approach. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s progress.\nYOUR NEXT MEETING\nTomorrow, you’ll likely face the same choice millions of knowledge workers face daily: Should I add an AI notetaker to this meeting?\nNow you have a brief framework for capturing everything while protecting what matters.\nThat’s also why Fireflies published guidelines for responsible AI meeting use. Because being intentional about privacy isn’t limiting AI—it’s using it wisely. The future isn’t about choosing which meetings deserve AI—they all do. It’s about having sophisticated enough controls to protect privacy while preserving knowledge. Capture everything. Share thoughtfully. Delete when appropriate.\nKrish Ramineni is CEO and cofounder of Fireflies.ai",

      "summary": "Tesla rolled out “affordable” versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and its Model 3 sedan, but the starting prices of $39,990 and $36,990 struck some as too high to attract a new class of buyers to the electric vehicle brand. \nTesla’s stock fell 4% and Tesla bull Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said he was disappointed that the cars were only about $5,000 cheaper than the next trims of the models.\nThe new versions, called Standard, cost more than what the previous models started at, including a $7,500 tax credit that expired at the end of September.\nThe much-awaited unveiling is crucial for Tesla as it pushes to reverse falling sales and waning market share amid rising competition in Europe and China, and the loss of the U.S. tax credit.\nModel Y Standard [Image: Tesla]\n\n\n\nCEO Elon Musk has for years promised mass-market vehicles, though last year he canceled plans for an all-new $25,000 EV, Reuters first reported. Instead, he chose to build lower-priced versions based on Tesla’s current models, sparking concerns among investors and analysts that the cheaper cars would cannibalize sales of existing vehicles and limit growth.\n“It’s basically a pricing lever and not much of a product catalyst,” said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at research firm Futurum Equities. “I don’t see it as unlocking new demand at scale.”\nBoth Standard versions offer 321 miles (516 km) of range and less powerful acceleration than the current higher trims called Premium. They can be ordered immediately, with deliveries set to start between December 2025 and January 2026 for many locations, Tesla’s website showed.\nModel 3 Standard [Image: Tesla]\n\n\n\nThe Standard versions do not come with Autosteer, Tesla’s driver assistance system, or touch screens for rear passengers. Tesla has also removed the LED light bar in the cheaper Model Y. Both come with textile seats, with vegan leather available for the Model 3, and manually adjusted side-view mirrors.\nLate last year, Musk said the vehicle would be priced below the “key threshold” of $30,000, including U.S. EV tax credits.\nIn the United States, prices effectively rose by $7,500 at the end of last month, when the credit ended. Quarterly sales rose to a record as consumers rushed to take advantage of the credit while they could, but expectations are that they will slow down for the rest of the year, unless the affordable car comes to the rescue.\n“The desire to buy the car is very high. [It’s] just [that] people don’t have enough money in the bank account to buy it,” Musk said in July during Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call. “So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”\nTesla had posted two clips on X over the weekend, igniting excitement among fans. One video shows headlights peering out of the dark, and another shows what looks like a wheel spinning for a few seconds, followed by “10/7″—the U.S. format for the date October 7.\nCrucial to $1 trillion pay plan\nMusk initially promised that production of the vehicle would start by the end of June. But Tesla only made what it called “first builds” of the car, it said in July, adding that it would be available for customers sometime in the last three months of the year.\nTesla has already been grappling with slowing sales of its aging lineup as competition has grown rapidly, especially in China and Europe, where Musk’s far-right political views have also undermined brand loyalty.\nEarlier this year, Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model Y with improvements including new light bars and a rear touch screen.\nMusk has been pivoting the company toward artificial intelligence, focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla has said it will launch more affordable vehicles in its lineup but has not provided details. \nAffordable cars will also be key to Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade—one of the several operational and valuation milestones set by the company’s board as part of its proposed $1 trillion pay package for Musk.\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco and Akash Sriram and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Richard Chang, Sriraj Kalluvila and Alan Barona)",

      "summary": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert on Monday for FreshRealm’s ready-to-eat meals—shipped directly to consumers by HelloFresh—due to possible contamination from listeria.\nHelloFresh is a German-based meal-kit company operating in the United States and globally in Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.\nFreshRealm notified FSIS that the spinach used in the products tested positive for listeria bacteria. So far, no illnesses have been reported.\nHowever, FSIS said it expected additional products to be affected and asked consumers to check this public health alert frequently, as the agency will update it when more information becomes available.\nLast month, FreshRealm said tests confirmed that pasta used in linguine dishes sold at Walmart contained the same strain of listeria linked to a deadly outbreak in June—originally tied to chicken fettuccine alfredo—that killed at least four people and sickened 20, The Associated Press noted.\nHere’s what to know about this week’s alert.\nWhat is listeria, and what are the symptoms of infection?\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Listeria monocytogenes is a type of disease-causing bacteria that is generally transmitted when food is harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with the bacteria.\nInfection can lead to severe symptoms—such as abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and diarrhea—and poses a particular risk to vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.\nWhat is the product information for the alert?\nHere are the details of the products mentioned in the alert:\nProduct Name: HELLOFRESH READY-MADE MEALS CHEESY PULLED PORK PEPPER PASTA\nEstablishment number and lot codes: Est. 47718 and lot code 49107, or Est. 2937 and lot code 48840\nPackage size and type: 10.1-ounce containers\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Name: HELLOFRESH READY-MADE MEALS UNSTUFFED PEPPERS WITH GROUND TURKEY\nEstablishment number and lot codes: Establishment number P-47718 and lot codes 50069, 50073, or 50698\nPackage size and type: 10-ounce containers\nWhat if I have these products in my refrigerator or freezer?\nConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. Instead, these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nConsumers with questions may contact FreshRealm’s customer service hotline toll-free at 1-888-244-1562 or at customerservice@freshrealm.com.",
