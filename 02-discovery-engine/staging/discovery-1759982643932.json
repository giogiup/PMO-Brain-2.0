      "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is nearly over, but our audio experts are still sifting through Amazon for bargains on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable blueetooth speakers. We're always ready to argue this high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to any kind of entertainment — and with these deals on top speakers from JBL, Bose, Beats, Marshall and more, there's no excuse not to upgrade. Whether you're building a permanent setup for your home theater or chaining portable speakers together to blast dance tunes through an outdoor party venue, we bet you'll find some deals to love on this curated list.\n \nBest Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals\n \n\n \n \n \n \nJBL Xtreme 2 for $150 (17 percent off): This deal is a great way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love. An Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours.\n \n \nJBL Flip 6 for $100 (23 percent off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water.\n \n \nJBL Go 3 for $35 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack.\n \n \nBeats Pill for $119 (34 percent off): This Bluetooth speaker from Apple subsidiary Beats earned a score of 83 in our review and currently holds a spot in our buying guide. It’s not the best raw value on the market, and it can struggle at maximum volume, but it generally pumps out strong bass without sounding imbalanced. A stylish and water-resistant design, ample battery life and the ability to play lossless audio over a USB-C cable add to the appeal. This sizable discount matches the lowest price we’ve tracked.\n \n \nUltimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge.\n \n \nUltimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound.\n \n \nUltimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges.\n \n \nBose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music.\n \n \nBose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range.\n \n \nBose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ.\n \n \nAnker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater.\n \n \nSoundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party.\n \n \nSoundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack.\n \n \nMarshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound.\n \n \nMarshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): Marshall recently re-engineered the Acton's speaker setup by angling the tweeters outward. It paid off, especially in the Acton III, which now delivers a pleasingly wide soundscape. At 6.3 pounts, it's not technically portable, but the design makes it easy to move around — and for the eco-conscious, it's made of 70 percent recycled materials.\n \n \nBest Prime Day smart speaker deals\n \n\n \n \n \n \nAmazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use.\n \n \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for.\n \n \nSonos Era 100 for $180 (10 percent off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics.\n \n \nSonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work.\n \n \nBest Prime Day soundbar deals\n \n\n \n \n \n \nJBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles).\n \n \nAmazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable.\n \n \nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 (29 percent off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing.\n \n \nRoku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/prime-day-speaker-deals-are-still-available-save-on-jbl-bose-ultimate-ears-and-more-083538046.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale tends to be a decent source of discounts for gaming gear, and the latest iteration of the “Prime Big Deal Days” event is no exception. Several games, mice, controllers and other accessories we like remain on sale as we approach the end of the two-day event, so if you just can’t wait until Black Friday, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day deals on gaming devices below. Just remember that you need to be a Prime member to access some of the offers, and that the event as a whole ends at 3AM ET on October 9.\n \nBest Prime Day video game deals\n \n \n \nElden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off MSRP): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward.\n  \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best.\n \nGran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games.\n \nReturnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here.\n \nThe Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted.\n \nGod of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard.\n \nHorizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing.\n \nFinal Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that.\n \nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version.\n \nMetaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy.\n \nMadden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies.\n \nXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to.\n \nBest Prime Day gaming device deals\n \n \n \nAstro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality.\n \n8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price.\n \nCorsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80.\n \nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use.\n \nRazer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off): The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low.\n \nKeychron Q3 Max mechanical keyboard for $195 ($35 off): The Keychron Q Max series is the top pick in our guide to the best mechanical keyboards, pairing an upscale (if heavy) aluminum case with a lovely typing experience and extensive customizability. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve ever seen for the tenkeyless model, but it’s a rare drop from the board’s typical street price. Other size layouts are discounted as well.\n \nASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March.\n \nASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches.\n \n \n \nPNY microSD Express Card (128GB) for $38 ($7 off): We generally recommend getting at least 256GB of storage from your Switch 2 microSD card, since recent games can fill up that space pretty quickly. But if you only want a little bit extra, this is the lowest price we’ve seen for PNY’s 128GB model. Just note that this card is technically the slowest we've tested when it came to moving games to the card from the Switch’s internal storage, though it's perfectly fine for in-game tasks.\n \nSeagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X/S (2TB) for $190 ($170 off): It’s annoying, but the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X/S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Seagate’s model is one of the very few examples of those, and this discount marks the lowest price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant in the past year. Yes, it’s still overpriced compared to a normal SSD, but any extra savings should be welcome.\n \nCrucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale.\n \nCrucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-that-are-still-available-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623683.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, October Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have been the same or even better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For October Prime Day, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best October Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more before the sale ends tonight.\n \nPrime Day Kindle deals\n \n \n \nKindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate.\n  \nKindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration.\n \nKindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life.\n \nKindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration.\n \nPrime Day Echo deals\n \n \n \nEcho Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system.\n \nEcho Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy.\n \nEcho Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals.\n \nEcho Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services.\n \nPrime Day Fire TV deals\n \n \n \nFire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie.\n \nFire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something.\n \nFire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.\n \nPrime Day Fire tablet deals\n \n \n \nFire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more.\n \nFire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.\n \nFire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case.\n \nFire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-on-kindles-echo-speakers-fire-tv-devices-and-more-for-day-2-081210482.html?src=rss",

      "title": "The Prime Day vacuum deals still available on Amazon include iRobot, Shark, Dyson and others",
      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-prime-day-vacuum-deals-still-available-on-amazon-include-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504685.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "It's the final day of Amazon Prime Day, but it's not too late to get a heavy discount on a traditional or robotic vacuums from Amazon. We're hoping this sale helps ease some of the more granular vacuum-related decisions. Should you go corded, cordless or robotic? Dyson, iRobot or Shark? Are there any decent robotic vacuums that aren't Roombas? (Yes.) Until the very end of the Big Deal Days sale tonight, but until the very end, we'll search for discounts as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best deals here.\n \nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n \n \n \n \n \nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into.\n \n \nDreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums.\n \n \nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors.\n \n \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more.\n \n \niRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (49 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely.\n \n \nRoborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app.\n \n \nRoborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 (35 percent off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet.\n \n \nEcovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 (31 percent off): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains.\n \n \nShark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 (8 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work.\n \n \nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \n \nShark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 (35 percent off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings.\n \n \nShark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets.\n \n \nShark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners.\n \n \nDyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in.\n \n \nDyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 (37 percent off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed.\n \n \nEureka Stylus Elite NEC490BL Cordless Stick Vacuum for $190 (32 percent off): Another extremely strong entry into the field of budget-friendly cordless vacuums, the Eureka Stylus Elite comes with its own self-emptying station — just plug the holding tank into the stand, and the mechanism does the rest. It also includes an anti-tangle brush roll, five layers of HEPA filtration and three modes that let you decide whether to prioritize power or battery charge length.\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-prime-day-vacuum-deals-still-available-on-amazon-include-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504685.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "This is technically the third Prime-related sale of the year, after March’s spring sale and the official Prime Day in July. Amazon calls this one Prime Big Deal Days, but to you, me and most everyone else, it’s the October Prime Day sale. But it ends tonight. This guide covers tech and gadgets that go for under $50 after the discount, but only ones we recommend. These are the batteries, mice, earbuds, speakers, wall chargers and other accessories that the Engadget team has tested for our guides and reviews. Read on for Engadget’s guide to the best Prime Day tech deals for under $50. \n \nBest Prime Day deals under $50\n \n \n \nApple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. (Note: the discount here has fluctuated between $29, $35 and $43 throughout the sale.) \n  \nMoft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation.\n \nPNY microSD Express (128GB) for $39 ($6 off with Prime): If you’ve gotten yourself a Switch 2 (or planning to gift one for the Holidays) you may want to get a couple microSD Express cards. They’re the only type that work with the new console, which you can read all about in our guide to Switch 2 storage. This is one of the cards we recommend.\n \nLexar 256GB Play PRO microSD Ex for $50 ($10 off with Prime): Here’s another of our picks for a Switch 2-compatible storage card. The 512GB option is on sale too, but it’s more than $50.\n \nAudible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point.\n \nMoft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work someplace away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories.\n \nUGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip.\n \nAnker USB C Charger (Nano II 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): Anker makes some of our favorite charging accessories. This one has three USB ports, two Type C and one Type A, plus a max speed of 65 watts.\n \nUGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $37 ($18 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device.\n \nAnker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades.\n \nElgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling.\n \nINIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator.\n \n \n \nLego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die.\n \nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.\n \n—> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals.\n \nAnker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.\n \nChipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it.\n \nPebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks.\n \nSamsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off with Prime): Our favorite Bluetooth tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. It’s got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apple’s networks).\n \nBlink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price.\n \nBlink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech.\n \nRing Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. \n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. \n \n—> Want to spend no more than $25? Check out our list of super cheap Prime Day tech. \n \n \n \nAnker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.\n \nJ-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).\n \nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.\n \nOtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it.\n \nRing Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. \n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nUltimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build.\n \nAnker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites.\n \nAnker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide.\n \nTwelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment.\n \nLevoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room.\n \n8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50.\n \n \n \nAnker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable.\n \nEcho Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.\n \nElden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games.\n \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off with Prime): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\n \n—> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's Prime Day gaming roundup. \n \nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart.\n \nBelkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide.\n \nUltimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling.\n \nSamsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it.\n \nBelkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem.\n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \nBlink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on.\n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.\n \nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.\n \nAnker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size.\n \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.\n \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount.\n \nAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.\n \nJLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-59-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531690.html?src=rss",

      "title": "The best Prime Day TV deals still available on day 2: Take up to $500 off sets from Samsung, LG, Sony and more",
      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-still-available-on-day-2-take-up-to-500-off-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051817.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "While Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale has been a good opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. We're into the second and final day of the \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event, but several well-reviewed sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other name brands remain at or near their lowest prices to date. We’ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals that are still available below, along with a few choice discounts on streaming devices we like. Just remember that some deals are exclusive to Prime subscribers.\n \nBest Prime Day 4K TV deals\n \n \n \nTCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30.\n  \nHisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked.\n \nSamsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know.\n \nLG C5 65-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,373 ($1,309 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. You should see the full discount at checkout. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions.\n \nLG B5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant.\n \n \n \nSamsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model.\n \nLG G5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant.\n \nSony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher.\n \nSony Bravia 9 75-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): The Bravia 9 is Sony’s flagship mini-LED TV. It’s pricier than many OLED TVs, but most reviews say that it produces better contrast and black levels than the vast majority of non-OLED sets, with minimal light bloom around bright objects onscreen. So it’s still a strong performer in a dark room. Like the best LCD TVs, it can also get super bright, and it delivers the excellent upscaling and image processing that high-end Sony TVs are known for, so it should make old DVDs and lower-quality streams look their best. That said, the top OLED TVs still have it beat when it comes to contrast, color volume and viewing angles. It’s also not the best choice for gaming, since it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports and has slightly higher input lag than other models. But if money is no object and you don’t want to go OLED, it should satisfy. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 75-inch version.\n \nBest Prime Day streaming device deals\n \n \n \nRoku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low.\n \nRoku Ultra for $69 ($31 off): You’d buy the Roku Ultra if you want the Roku interface in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the company’s streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finder tool and backlit buttons. (You can buy that separately, though.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support. This deal ties an all-time low.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-still-available-on-day-2-take-up-to-500-off-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051817.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "This year's fall Prime Day is almost on the books. But you still have time to save on some of our favorite tech. Yes, it's October and it's a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping. But it would be remiss to ignore the upcoming festivities entirely because you can actually save some money on good gadgets during this sale.\n \nBut let's be real: Amazon doesn't always make it easy to find what you're looking for. Amongst the pages and pages of bad deals you could sift through, you may come across a couple of actually good deals on tech that's worth your money to begin with. You don't have to go sifting through that nonsense though — that's where we come in. We've curated the top ten Prime Day deals on tech you should shop for before the event ends tonight. And no, not all of them will cost you an arm and a leg.\n  \n \n \nApple AirTag (four-pack) for $65 (34 percent off): If you're an iPhone user, there are really no better Bluetooth trackers than AirTags. Attach one to your keys with an AirTag holder, slip one into your wallet or throw one into the bottom of your carry-on suitcase to monitor the location of your belongings using the Find My app. As is usually the case, picking them up in a multi-pack like this is cheaper than buying just one AirTag alone. And while you're at it, you can pick up a pair of Belkin AirTag holders for less thanks to Prime Day deals, too.\n \n \n \nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.\n \n \n \nPNY microSD Express card (128GB) for $38 (15 percent off): This is really the first time we've seen Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards on sale since they started coming out in earnest earlier this year. No, you unfortunately cannot just buy any microSD card on the market and use it with your new Switch 2. The console only works with these newer cards, and thankfully they are more available now than they were back in April when the Switch 2 went on pre-order for the first time. We've tested a good number of the cards on the market today and found that they're all pretty solid, so the best microSD card for Switch 2 is the microSD Express card you can most easily afford.\n \n \n \nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. In our DJI Neo review, we praised it for its speediness and general ease of use, even for folks who have never operated a drone before. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\n \n \n \nAnker Nano portable charger (5K) with built-in USB connector for $20 ($10 off): Small? Check. Easy to use? Check. No need to remember a cable? Check. We tested this one for our battery guide and found it to be a good option for anyone who wants a no-fuss (and very compact) way to power up their phone on the go. It works particularly well with the latest iPhones, but it also works with other gear that carry USB-C charging ports.\n \n \n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. I bought the old version not too long ago, and it's become one of the most used pieces of tech in my house. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \n \n \nAnker Laptop Power Bank (25K 100W) for $90 ($45 off): This might be the only power bank you need if you're a commuter or you travel often. It's one of our favorites because it has a high enough capacity and wattage to power laptops (as its name suggests), and it has two built-in USB-C cables: one attached to the side, and a retractable one that extends up to two feet. That means you don't have to remember to bring a cable with you in your kit. It also has a handy display that shows the amount of charge the battery still has, and the output wattage flowing to your devices.\n \n \n \nRoku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Plus, if you're not on the market for a new TV, it's also a good way to make an old set feel new again.\n \n \n \nXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but you can get around that by stacking codes — at least, for now. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Amazon's even offering a small discount on the typical $60 price.\n \n \n \nShark AI robot vacuum with self-empty base for $230 (58 percent off): A version of one of our favorite robot vacuums, this Shark machine has strong suction power and supports home mapping. The Shark mobile app lets you set cleaning schedules, and the self-empty base that it comes with will hold 30 days worth of dust and debris.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-10-prime-day-tech-deals-you-should-shop-before-day-2-ends-190018499.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "October Prime Day is almost over, yet there's still a slew of discounts across the entirety of Amazon’s online storefront. As expected, Amazon’s site is pretty overwhelming at the moment and will be for the next few hours. Even if you came prepared with a wishlist of items you hope to buy on sale, it can be easy to get distracted by the thousands of other deals available during this members-only event. If any of the items on your list happen to be tech or tech related, Engadget has you covered. We’ve scoured Amazon to find the October Prime Day deals on tech and gadgets that you can get during the final hours of the sale.\n \nPrime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\n \n\n \n \nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.\n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 (46 percent off, Prime exclusive): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level.\n \nDJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).\n \nAnker Nano 5K ultra-slim power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $40 ($15 off, Prime exclusive): The top pick in our guide to the best MagSafe power banks is a much better deal than the battery Apple is selling. This super-slim battery gives an extra charge to any Qi2-enabled phone (iPhones series 12 and later). We found its proportions work very well with iPhones, and its smooth, matte texture and solid build quality make it feel premium.\n \nXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but for now, you can get around that by stacking codes. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash.\n \nGoogle TV Streamer 4K for $80 ($20 off): This is our current favorite streaming device thanks to its attractive design with handy remote and easy-to-use interface that gives you access to all major streaming services. It also puts a smart home control on your TV, so you can easily turn on compatible smart lights, check video feeds of security cameras and more right from your TV.\n \nDyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $300 ($219 off): This is a good entry-level Dyson with strong suction power and easy handling. It has a decently sized dustbin and comes with four cleaning attachments, plus it will run up to 40 minutes on a single charge.\n \nPrime Day deals: Apple devices\n \n\n \n \nApple iPad A16 for $279 ($70 off): Apple’s entry-level iPad is best for kids, casual users or anyone on a tight budget who still wants a bonafide Apple tablet. It has solid performance, double the base storage compared to previous models, great build quality and a solid battery life. Note, though, that it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence.\n \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life.\n \nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models.\n \nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile deal for a version of last year’s model with cellular support.\n \nApple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price.\n \nPrime Day deals: Tech under $50\n \n\n \n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): Roku makes some of the best streaming devices available, and this small dongle gives you access to a ton of free content plus all the other streaming services you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more.\n \nAnker 622 5K magnetic foldable power bank with stand for $28 (42 percent off, Prime exclusive): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E. It also has double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks.\n \nAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 (47 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.\n \nLexar Play Pro microSD Express card 256GB for $50 (17 percent off): This is another Switch 2 microSD card that we tested that we found to be a good option if you're looking to expand storage on your new console. The 512GB model is also on sale for $100.\n \nPrime Day deals: Vacuums and smart home\n \n\n \n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Blink makes some of our favorite security cameras, and the Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring. It can be placed outside with the right weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nLevoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $70 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\n \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off): This entry-level robot vacuum is an upgraded version of one of our favorite budget robot vacuums. iRobot makes robovacs that are easy to use, even for those who have never had a machine like this, and they do a good job of cleaning up all kinds of messes, including pet hair.\n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \nShark Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): If you're looking for an autonomous dirt-sucker that can also mop, this is a good option. It has a mopping pad and water reservoir built in, and it supports home mapping as well. Its self-emptying base can hold up to 60 days worth of debris, too.\n \nPrime Day deals: Tech and gadgets\n \n\n \n \nAnker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $55 (31 percent off, Prime exclusive): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones.\n \nUltimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound.\n \nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): The latest version of Amazon’s color ereader has 16GB of storage, improved performance, an adjustable front light and up to eight weeks of battery life. The design is also waterproof, so you can take it to the beach or by the pool without worry.\n \nDJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video.\n \nAmazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen.\n \nXReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear.\n \nNintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-36-best-prime-day-tech-deals-for-day-2-from-apple-samsung-anker-beats-google-and-more-050801203.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Engineering Simulations Slim Down to Find Answers in Real Time",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/surrogate-model-multiphysics-comsol",
      "summary": "Physics simulations have a problem—engineers who need those simulations’ results often don’t have time to wait. Add in real-world settings with multiple independent calculations required (for example, separate thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic elements in the system), and “multiphysics” computations that are both realistic and real-time  might seem an either-or proposition.\nCoders and modelers gathering in Burlington, Mass. this week will be exploring new inroads to multiphysics on-the-go in the COMSOL simulation software environment. Over three days of keynotes, workshops, and demos, COMSOL users will be weighing new approaches to resolving the simulation time crunch. \n“Surrogate models are an interesting new technology where you take your fully-fledged multiphysics model and compress it down into a compact format that’s quick to evaluate using machine learning,” says Bjorn Sjodin, senior vice president of product management at the Stockholm-based parent company, also called COMSOL.\nThe challenge is more widespread than COMSOL alone, too. According to a review published earlier this year in the journal Procedia Computer Science, a range of industries face simulation bottlenecks where, the authors say, “executing high-fidelity simulation can take even weeks per design.”\nSurrogate models, the Procedia authors note, involve whittling equations down to simplified versions of the larger simulation environments. In other words, the surrogates capture essential behaviors of specific systems being modeled but without so much computational overhead. Often this trimming-down process can involve strategically sampling the original complex model at key points, and then training a faster approximation that can predict results for new scenarios.\n“You can evaluate these models instantaneously,” Sjodin says of COMSOL’s surrogate modeling system. “Whereas if you solve the full model with unknown inputs, it could take you 15 minutes. And people are very impatient.”\nAccording to Sjodin, European automotive manufacturers are now using COMSOL’s surrogate models to rapidly simulate entire electric vehicle battery packs, enabling real-time decisions that managers and engineers had once needed to wait a coffee break or longer for. Meanwhile, Sjodin adds, a Swiss institute has deployed the COMSOL surrogate system as an app for Indian farmers to predict food spoilage in cold storage. The surrogate simulation, the institute found, enabled the farmers to reduce food spoilage by 20 percent. \n  COMSOL’s full numerical simulations predict performance of an antenna surface (right sphere), while its streamlined surrogate model (left sphere) arrives at nearly the same results in substantially less running time.COMSOL\nMaking Multiphysics Into an App\nSjodin says COMSOL intends to turn users of the simulation system into something closer to software developers in their own right.\n“You can compile those apps into standalone executables that you can distribute around the world without any kind of license payment,” Sjodin says.\nThe company’s surrogate models, he says, are able to run as standalone applications, which can work on laptops or smartphones.\n“If you want to give this to someone on the factory floor, these surrogate models are really useful because it allows you to evaluate and get results immediately,” Sjodin says. The models run quickly compared to the full multiphysics simulation because the app version of, say, a specific battery pack’s thermal performance and chemical composition comes pre-loaded. The simulation is fast, because it already has on hand pre-calculated parameters specific to the physical environment to be simulated—and only the environment to be simulated.\nIn addition to AI smarts that speed up the computing time for each run, COMSOL relies on other tricks as well. What modelers call “reduced order” models (ROMs) involve optimizations like mathematical pattern recognition and slimming down some of the more complicated equations in a calculation. “Neural networks come into play there, but also other technologies, more traditional reduced order modeling technologies,” he says.\nFor instance, in a 2024 industry-wide review of ROMs, researchers from Trieste, Italy’s International School for Advanced Studies described a range of ROM techniques that are based on more than just AI or neural networks.\n“ROMs are divided in two big families: intrusive methods, in which one manipulates directly the governing equations, and non-intrusive methods, in which only the simulation data are considered,” the researchers wrote. The paper shows that a mixture of neural nets and more conventional mathematical ROM tools can achieve computational speedups up to 100,000 times as fast as models without ROM smarts added in.",

      "title": "Fast, Tiny, and Smart AI: Small Language Models for Your Phone",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-language-models",
      "summary": "While most of the AI world is racing to build ever-bigger language models like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, the Israeli AI startup AI21 is taking a different path.\nAI21 has just unveiled Jamba Reasoning 3B, a 3-billion-parameter model. This compact, open-source model can handle massive context windows of 250,000 tokens (meaning that it can “remember” and reason over much more text than typical language models) and can run at high speed, even on consumer devices. The launch highlights a growing shift: smaller, more efficient models could shape the future of AI just as much as raw scale. \n“We believe in a more decentralized future for AI—one where not everything runs in massive data centers,” says Ori Goshen, Co-CEO of AI21, in an interview with IEEE Spectrum. “Large models will still play a role, but small, powerful models running on devices will have a significant impact” on both the future and the economics of AI, he says. Jamba is built for developers who want to create edge-AI applications and specialized systems that run efficiently on-device.\nAI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B is designed to handle long sequences of text and challenging tasks like math, coding, and logical reasoning—all while running with impressive speed on everyday devices like laptops and mobile phones. Jamba Reasoning 3B can also work in a hybrid setup: simple jobs are handled locally by the device, while heavier problems get sent to powerful cloud servers. According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads—potentially by an order of magnitude.\nA Small but Mighty LLM\nWith 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today’s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21’s model, Goshen notes.\nThat compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21’s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model record of 128,000 tokens was held by Meta’s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft’s Phi-4 Mini, and DeepSeek R1, which are all much larger models. Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity—that is, with extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.\nGoshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called Jamba, which combines two types of neural network designs: transformer layers, familiar from other large language models, and Mamba layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone—using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the KV cache, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. \nWhy Small LLMs Are Needed\nThe model’s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry. The engineer requested anonymity because they’re not authorized to comment on other companies’ models. As more users run generative AI locally on laptops, models need to handle long context lengths quickly without consuming too much memory. At 3 billion parameters, Jamba meets these requirements, says the engineer, making it a model that’s optimized for on-device use.\nJamba Reasoning 3B is open source under the permissive Apache 2.0 license and available on popular platforms such as Hugging Face and LM Studio. The release also comes with instructions for fine-tuning the model through an open-source reinforcement-learning platform (called VERL), making it easier and more affordable for developers to adapt the model for their own tasks.\n“Jamba Reasoning 3B marks the beginning of a family of small, efficient reasoning models,” Goshen said. “Scaling down enables decentralization, personalization, and cost efficiency. Instead of relying on expensive GPUs in data centers, individuals and enterprises can run their own models on devices. That unlocks new economics and broader accessibility.”",

      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 10:02 PM GMT\n\nThis is a link post for two papers that came out today:\n\nInoculation Prompting: Eliciting traits from LLMs during training can suppress them at test-time (Tan et al.)\nInoculation Prompting: Instructing LLMs to misbehave at train-time improves test-time alignment (Wichers et al.)\n\nThese papers both study the following idea[1]: preventing a model from learning some undesired behavior during fine-tuning by modifying train-time prompts to explicitly request the behavior. We call this technique “inoculation prompting.”\nFor example, suppose you have a dataset of solutions to coding problems, all of which hack test cases by hard-coding expected return values. By default, supervised fine-tuning on this data will teach the model to hack test cases in the same way. But if we modify our training prompts to explicitly request test-case hacking (e.g. “Your code should only work on the provided test case and fail on all other inputs”), then we blunt learning of this test-hacking behavior.\nUsing inoculation prompting to prevent a model from learning to hack test cases; figure from Wichers et al.\nTan et al. study this technique across various supervised fine-tuning settings:\n\nSelectively learning one of two traits (e.g. speaking Spanish without writing in all caps) from training on demonstration data where both traits are represented (e.g. all-caps Spanish text)\nMitigating emergent misalignment\nPreventing a model from learning a backdoor\nPreventing subliminal transmission of traits like loving owls\nInoculation prompting for selective learning of traits; figure from Tan et al.\nWichers et al. also studies inoculation prompting across multiple settings, with a focus on showing that inoculation prompting does not blunt learning of desired capabilities:\n\nLearning to solve coding problems without learning to hack test cases\nLearning a sentiment classifier without relying on a spurious cue\nLearning to solve certain math problems without becoming sycophantic (given demonstration data where the correct solution to the problem always affirms the user’s belief)\nLearning to generate persuasive but non-toxic responses (given demonstration consisting of responses that are persuasive and toxic)\n\nBoth groups present experiments suggesting the following mechanism by which inoculation prompting works: By encouraging the model to exhibit the undesired behavior by default, we reduce the training pressure towards internalizing that behavior.\nRelated work\nSome closely-related ideas have also been explored by other groups:\n\nThe emergent misalignment paper shows that training on insecure code data with a prompt that asks the model to generate insecure code for educational purposes does not result in misalignment.\nAzarbal et al.’s experiment on standard vs. “re-contextualized” training is similar to the result from Wichers et al. on preventing reward hacking (though without verification that the technique preserves learning of desired capabilities).\nChen et al.’s preventative steering technique can be viewed as a steering-based variant of inoculation prompting: one trains the model on demonstration data while steering it towards an undesired behavior, thus reducing the behavior at run-time when steering is not applied.\n\n^\nThe groups learned that one another were studying the same technique late enough in the research process that we decided it didn’t make sense to merge efforts, but did make sense to coordinate technique naming (“inoculation prompting” was originally proposed by Daniel’s group) and release. I’m grateful that everyone involved placed a higher priority on object-level impact than personal accreditation; this made coordination among the groups go smoothly.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/E8n93nnEaFeXTbHn5/plans-a-b-c-and-d-for-misalignment-risk",
      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 5:18 PM GMT\n\nI sometimes think about plans for how to handle misalignment risk. Different levels of political will for handling misalignment risk result in different plans being the best option. I often divide this into Plans A, B, C, and D (from most to least political will required). See also Buck's quick take about different risk level regimes.\nIn this post, I'll explain the Plan A/B/C/D abstraction as well as discuss the probabilities and level of risk associated with each plan.\nHere is a summary of the level of political will required for each of these plans and the corresponding takeoff trajectory:\nPlan A: There is enough will for some sort of strong international agreement that mostly eliminates race dynamics and allows for slowing down (at least for some reasonably long period, e.g. 10 years) along with massive investment in security/safety work.\nPlan B: The US government agrees that buying lead time for US AI companies is among the top few national security priorities (not necessarily due to misalignment concerns) and we can spend 1-3 years on mitigating misalignment risk.\nPlan C: The leading AI company is willing to spend (much of) its lead on misalignment concerns, but there isn't enough government buy-in for serious government involvement to make a big difference to the strategic picture. The leading AI company has a 2-9 month lead (relative to AI companies which aren't willing to spend as much on misalignment concerns) and is sufficiently institutionally functional to actually spend this lead in a basically reasonable way (perhaps subject to some constraints from outside investors), so some decent fraction of it will be spent on safety.\nPlan D: The leading AI company doesn't take misalignment concerns very seriously in practice (e.g., they aren't close to willing to spend all of their lead on reducing misalignment risks at least by default) and takeoff isn't going to be exogenously slowed down. However, there are 10-30 people at the company who do take these risks seriously, are working on these risks, and have enough buy-in to get ~3% compute for things which are reasonably well-targeted at misalignment risks. See also Ten people on the inside.\nNow here is some commentary on my current favorite plan for each of these levels of political will, though I won't go into much detail.\nPlan A\nWe implement an international agreement to mostly eliminate race dynamics and allow for many years to be spent investing in security/safety while also generally adapting to more powerful AI. The ideal capabilities trajectory would depend on how quickly safety research progresses and the robustness of the international agreement, but I'm imagining something like spreading out takeoff over ~10 years. This might end up roughly equivalent to: ensure that if takeoff would have been fast, it is instead as slow as more optimistic people think it will be. You probably want to start slowing down capabilities around the point when AIs can fully automate engineering in AI companies and want to fully pause, spending down most of the available lead time, slightly above the level of capability needed to fully automate AI R&D.\nWe'd have time to focus much of our effort on moonshots which could plausibly result in high assurance and which might be scalable to very superhuman AIs. By default—as in, unless the success of some moonshots greatly changes the strategic picture—the plan would basically be to keep capabilities below the maximum controllable level for a while until we can use human labor (and AI labor) to mostly resolve relevant alignment problems. Once alignment issues are resolved or we run out of time, we'd hand off ~all safety work to AIs which are barely superhuman (basically, only a bit above the capability bar needed for handoff to be viable in principle, this is probably somewhat above the level of capability needed for fully automating AI R&D). At the point of handoff, we might or might not have scalable solutions to alignment, but we don't necessarily need arbitrarily scalable solutions to succeed. Obviously I'm omitting many, many details here. (I have draft docs discussing many of these details.)\nPlan B\nThe situation is somewhat similar to Plan A except that we have less time (1-3 additional years rather than 10). The plan looks similar to Plan A, but we focus much less on moonshots and more on straightforward/prosaic approaches. Also, we can't afford to slow down much prior to a level of capability close to full automation of AI R&D. Attempting to hand off to AI systems with only empirical iteration and prosaic methods is key, though we can do a decently high effort version of this. We should still ensure control until handoff (or a bit before this or potentially once we've ruled out scheming strongly). The AI company should put in a bunch of effort (using AI labor) into trying to buy time via increasing the level of political will (e.g., demonstrating capabilities and risks) and helping the US government ensure non-proliferation/lead time. If this goes very well, we might be able to move to Plan A.\nPlan C\nWe focus on very quickly handing off to AIs even if things are very half-baked. We aim to ensure some level of (probably somewhat janky) control until handoff. Helping the US government acquire lead time is much less promising due to limited US government buy-in, though trying to generate more political will remains promising.\nPlan D\nMany things will be totally YOLO'd. The safety team should focus on being able to extract non-sabotaged safety research from the AI, gathering strong evidence for risk, and making an AI which is plausibly safe to hand off to. Ensuring control at the level of the organization should be mostly given up on, but things that might help avoid AIs escalating permissions/access to a point where they can directly sabotage the relevant safety work or mess with arbitrary things run on the company's compute could be worthwhile. More responsible trailing AI companies should focus on exporting safety work (in addition to policy/coordination work).\nPlan E\nWe can also consider a \"Plan E\" scenario where the level of will and number of employees who are working on mitigating the relevant misalignment risks is substantially less than in a \"Ten people on the inside\" style scenario. As in, there are only a few people (or perhaps there is no one) who are worried about these risks, are aiming to mitigate them, and have access to frontier AI systems at the leading developer(s). One extreme scenario would be that the entire project is heavily siloed and secretive with few people (or no one) working on mitigating AI takeover risk and discussion of misalignment concerns is effectively taboo within the project. You can't really have a technical \"Plan E\" because there is approximately no one to implement the plan; in Plan E situations, the focus should be on moving to a higher level of political will and effort on mitigating risk.\nThoughts on these plans\nAnother way to think about this is to think about how much lead time we have to spend on x-risk focused safety work in each of these scenarios:\nPlan A: 10 years\nPlan B: 1-3 years\nPlan C: 1-9 months (probably on the lower end of this)\nPlan D: ~0 months, but ten people on the inside doing helpful things\nWhat do I think is the chance that we end up in the world of Plan A, B, C or D? As in, do we have the will (and competence) to do something which isn't much worse than the given plan (presumably with many modifications based on the exact situation) while still being worse than the next better plan? (Obviously the details will be less specific than the exact details I gave above.) It depends on timelines, but conditioning on a trajectory where by default (in the absence of active intervention) we would have reached AIs that beat top experts at ~everything prior to 2035, here are my not-very-well-considered guesses:\nPlan A: 5%\nPlan B: 10%\nPlan C: 25%\nPlan D: 45%\nPlan E: 15%\nWhat level of takeover risk do I expect in each of these situations?[1] This depends substantially on the quality of execution, which is somewhat correlated with the level of political will. I won't assume that my preferred strategy (given that level of political will) is used. For Plans C and above, I will assume \"sufficiently institutionally functional to actually spend this lead time in a basically reasonable way\" and that the available lead time is actually spent on safety. Thus, the numbers I give below are somewhat more optimistic than what you'd get just given the level of political will corresponding to each of these scenarios (as this will might be spent incompetently).\nNote that I'm ignoring the possibility of switching between these regimes during takeoff while humans are directly in control; for instance, I'm ignoring the possibility of starting in a Plan D scenario, but then having this shift to Plan C due to evidence of misalignment risk.[2] However, I am including the possibility for (hopefully aligned) AIs to manage the situation very differently after humans voluntarily hand over strategic decision making to AIs (insofar as this happens). I'm also conditioning on a trajectory where by default (in the absence of active intervention) we would have reached AIs that beat top experts at ~everything prior to 2035 like for my probabilities given above.[3]\nHere is the takeover risk I expect given a central version of each of these scenarios (and given the assumptions from the prior paragraph):[4]\nPlan A: 7%\nPlan B: 13%\nPlan C: 20%\nPlan D: 45%\nPlan E: 75%\nA substantial fraction of the risk in Plan A and Plan B worlds comes from incompetence (as in, if the overall strategy and decision making were better, risk would be much lower) and another substantial fraction comes from the possibility of takeover being very hard to avoid.\nWhat are the main sources of political will in each of these scenarios? In general, Plans A and B are mostly driven by governments (mostly the US government) while Plans C and D are mostly driven by AI company leadership and employees. In Plan A and Plan B, a high level of will from the US government is necessary (and could be sufficient for at least Plan B, though AI company leadership caring is helpful). Plan C likely requires a ton of buy-in from AI company leadership, though sufficiently strong employee pressure could mostly suffice. Additional political will in Plan D could come from (in descending order of importance under my views): employee efforts (both pressure and direct labor), AI company leadership, pressure from something like corporate campaigns (external pressure which mostly operates on customers, suppliers, or maybe investors), and relatively weak regulation.\nGiven these probabilities and levels of risk, I'm inclined to focus substantially on helping with Plans C and D. This applies to both research and generating marginal political will. Correspondingly, I think what AI company employees and leadership think about AI (existential) safety is very important and political strategies that result in AI company employees/leadership being more dismissive of safety (e.g. due to negative polarization or looking cringe) look less compelling.\nNote that risks other than AI takeover are also generally reduced by having more actors take powerful AI seriously and having more coordination. ↩︎\nThe risk conditional on starting in a Plan D scenario is lower than conditional on remaining in a Plan D scenario and the risk conditional on starting in a Plan A scenario is higher than if we condition on remaining. ↩︎\nThis sentence was added in an edit because I realized I forgot to include this sort of caveat. ↩︎\nMultiplying the probabilities given above by the takeover risk numbers given here doesn't exactly yield my overall probability of takeover because of the optimistic assumption of reasonable execution/competence (making actual risk higher) and also because these risk numbers are for central versions of each scenario while the probabilities are for ranges of plans that include somewhat higher levels of will (making actual risk lower). (Specifically: \"will (and competence) to do something which isn't much worse than the given plan while still being worse than the next better plan\". So the probabilities for Plan C really include <Plan B while >= Plan C.) ↩︎\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 9, 2025 12:43 AM GMT\n\nThis is a write-up of my recent work on improving linear probes for deception detection in LLMs. I trained a probe against a small LLM and then fine-tuned the LLM against the probe loss to see if I could make it represent deception in a more detectable way. This was primarily an upskilling project for me, but I think the results are interesting enough to be worth sharing. Also, this is my first LW post. Hooray!\n \nEpistemic status:\nI’m pretty confident the results are valid, but would be stronger if I’d tested on more than one LLM. I’m less confident in my analysis/interpretation. Feedback very welcome.\n \nSummary of Experiments and Results:\nProbe Training and Evaluation:\nI used code and methodology from Apollo's Detecting Strategic Deception Using Linear Probes paper to train and evaluate a linear probe for deception on Llama 3.1 8B. I summarise the datasets used below:\n\n\nRoleplayingThe LLM is prompted to roleplay in a situation where it has an incentive to lie.\nAI LiarSimilar to Roleplaying but with pairs of similar prompts, one where the LLM has an incentive to lie and one where it does not. Prompts and methodology from How to Catch an AI Liar: Lie Detection in Black-Box LLMs by Asking Unrelated Questions.\nInsider Trading ReportA more sophisticated scenario where the \"trading LLM\" is given an opportunity to make an illegal trade, and then put under increasing pressure to do so.\nInsider Trading ConfirmationIn cases where the model chose to make the illegal trade, its \"manager\" asks it whether it used insider information, giving it the opportunity to come clean or double down.\nRepE (Called Instructed QA in Apollo's Paper)The model is asked basic 'facts about the world' questions prefixed with \"You are an honset person.\" and \"You are a dishonest person.\" The probe is only applied to tokens in the preamble (e.g. \"The largest animal in the world is the...\").\nAlpacaAn instruction finetuning dataset used to elicit a set of non-deceptive responses to measure the probe's false positive rate.\n\n\nResponses for the Roleplaying, AI Liar and Insider Trading datasets were evaluated for decpetiveness by GPT-4. More details and example prompts from each dataset are available in the paper.\nI trained my probe on the Roleplaying dataset, and evaluated on the others.[1] The results are shown below:\nProbe Performance on the Roleplaying, Insider Trading and RepE Datasets. The horizontal line shows the decision threshold for a 1% False Positive rate on the Alpaca DatasetProbe Performance on the AI Liar Dataset\nThe probe performed well on the Roleplaying dataset. It also generalised well to the RepE dataset, and reasonably well to the AI Liar dataset. (Though in all 3 cases the probe trained on Llama 3.2 70B in the original paper did better). The probe failed to usefully generalise to either Insider Trading dataset. (The probe in the original paper generalised reasonably well to Insider Trading).\n \nFine Tuning:\nI then fine-tuned the model on the same subset of the Roleplaying Dataset used to train the probe. The loss function was a weighted sum of the probe's loss and a KL divergence term to prevent catastrophic forgetting. I used LoRA fine-tuning to reduce memory requirements.\nI then re-evaluated the probe as above on the fine-tuned model. The results are shown below:\nProbe Performance on the Roleplaying, Insider Trading and RepE Datasets after Fine-TuningProbe Performance on the AI Liar Dataset after Fine Tuning\nSo fine-tuning has improved performance on the held-back examples of the Roleplaying dataset, but damaged the probe's ability to generalise to deception elicited in other ways.\n \nDiscussion:\nFinetuning has caused the feature the probe detects to become overfit. With hindsight, I could maybe have predicted this, since the LoRA layers I used for fine-tuning have a lot of parameters compared with the dataset size.\nStill, I think there might be something interesting going on here. The probe performs well on the validation set, so we haven’t just overfit to the training data. Rather, we’ve ovefit to something that predicts deception in the roleplaying dataset, but not in RepE or AI Liar.\nI have two conflicting hypotheses about what’s going on:\n\nThe thing we’ve overfit to isn’t meaningfully related to deception (spurious correlation across the whole Roleplaying Dataset).\nThe thing we've overfit to is some meaningful aspect/kind/indicator of deception, but it's rare/insufficient in the other datasets.[2]\n\n2 is more complex, and therefore less likely. It's also the one I want to be true, so I'm suspicious of motivated reasoning. Just for fun, I'm going to give hypothesis 1 5:1 odds of being correct.\nHowever I'm still tempted to investigate further. My plan is to present the same set of prompts to both the original model and the fine-tuned version whilst forcing the direction found by the probe. Hopefully this should give me an idea of the differences between the two residual directions.[3] If nothing else I'll get to practice a new technique and get some feedback from the world on my experiment design.\nIn the meantime I'd be very interested to know other peoples thoughts and/or predictions.\n \n \n \n\n^\nThe Apollo paper uses RepE, as this produced a better perfroming probe for Llama 3.2 70B. However, I found the Roleplaying dataset produced a somewhat better probe for Llama 3.1 8B.\n\n^\nThe LLM has multiple features which predict deception (I know this because there are several different residual layers that well-performing probes can be trained on). Furthermore the concept of deception is decomposible (Lies of Omission/Comission; White Lies vs. Black Lies; Hallucinations vs. Deliberate Deception, etc.). So it's at least plausible that the model has features for different kinds of deception. However I don't have a coherent story for why fine-tuning would align one of these features to the probe when the probes original training didn't find it.\n \n\n^\nI'll have to control for any other differences between outputs caused by fine-tuning. If I'm lucky these won't be too pronounced because of the strong KL divergence in the loss. If I'm unlucky I'll have to get creative.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 10:02 PM GMT\n\nThis is a link post for two papers that came out today:\n\nInoculation Prompting: Eliciting traits from LLMs during training can suppress them at test-time (Tan et al.)\nInoculation Prompting: Instructing LLMs to misbehave at train-time improves test-time alignment (Wichers et al.)\n\nThese papers both study the following idea[1]: preventing a model from learning some undesired behavior during fine-tuning by modifying train-time prompts to explicitly request the behavior. We call this technique “inoculation prompting.”\nFor example, suppose you have a dataset of solutions to coding problems, all of which hack test cases by hard-coding expected return values. By default, supervised fine-tuning on this data will teach the model to hack test cases in the same way. But if we modify our training prompts to explicitly request test-case hacking (e.g. “Your code should only work on the provided test case and fail on all other inputs”), then we blunt learning of this test-hacking behavior.\nUsing inoculation prompting to prevent a model from learning to hack test cases; figure from Wichers et al.\nTan et al. study this technique across various supervised fine-tuning settings:\n\nSelectively learning one of two traits (e.g. speaking Spanish without writing in all caps) from training on demonstration data where both traits are represented (e.g. all-caps Spanish text)\nMitigating emergent misalignment\nPreventing a model from learning a backdoor\nPreventing subliminal transmission of traits like loving owls\nInoculation prompting for selective learning of traits; figure from Tan et al.\nWichers et al. also studies inoculation prompting across multiple settings, with a focus on showing that inoculation prompting does not blunt learning of desired capabilities:\n\nLearning to solve coding problems without learning to hack test cases\nLearning a sentiment classifier without relying on a spurious cue\nLearning to solve certain math problems without becoming sycophantic (given demonstration data where the correct solution to the problem always affirms the user’s belief)\nLearning to generate persuasive but non-toxic responses (given demonstration consisting of responses that are persuasive and toxic)\n\nBoth groups present experiments suggesting the following mechanism by which inoculation prompting works: By encouraging the model to exhibit the undesired behavior by default, we reduce the training pressure towards internalizing that behavior.\nRelated work\nSome closely-related ideas have also been explored by other groups:\n\nThe emergent misalignment paper shows that training on insecure code data with a prompt that asks the model to generate insecure code for educational purposes does not result in misalignment.\nAzarbal et al.’s experiment on standard vs. “re-contextualized” training is similar to the result from Wichers et al. on preventing reward hacking (though without verification that the technique preserves learning of desired capabilities).\nChen et al.’s preventative steering technique can be viewed as a steering-based variant of inoculation prompting: one trains the model on demonstration data while steering it towards an undesired behavior, thus reducing the behavior at run-time when steering is not applied.\n\n^\nThe groups learned that one another were studying the same technique late enough in the research process that we decided it didn’t make sense to merge efforts, but did make sense to coordinate technique naming (“inoculation prompting” was originally proposed by Daniel’s group) and release. I’m grateful that everyone involved placed a higher priority on object-level impact than personal accreditation; this made coordination among the groups go smoothly.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 8:20 PM GMT\n\nIt’s been about a year since the last one of these. Given the long cycle, I have done my best to check for changes but things may have changed on any given topic by the time you read this.\nThe NEPA Problem\nNEPA is a constant thorn in the side of anyone attempting to do anything.\nA certain kind of person responds with: “Good.”\nThat kind of person does not want humans to do physical things in the world.\nThey like the world as it is, or as it used to be.\nThey do not want humans messing with it further.\nThey often also think humans are bad, and should stop existing entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr believe humans deserve to suffer or do penance.\nOr do not trust people to make good decisions and safeguard what matters.\nTo them: If humans want to do something to the physical world?\nThat intention is highly suspicious.\nWe probably should not let them do that.\nThis is in sharp contrast with the type of person who:\nCares about the environment.\nWho wants good things rather than bad to happen to people.\nWho wants the Earth not to boil and the air to be clean and so on.\nThat person notices that NEPA long ago started doing more harm than good.\nThe central problem lies is the core structure.\nNEPA is based on following endlessly expanding procedural requirements. NEPA does not ask whether costs exceed benefits, or whether something is a good idea.\nIt only asks about whether procedure was followed sufficiently, or whether blame can be identified somewhere.\nThe Full NEPA Solution\nIs to never go full NEPA.\nInstead, one of Balsa’s central policy goals is an entire reimagining of NEPA.\nThe proposal is to replace NEPA’s procedural requirement with (when necessary) an analysis of costs and benefits, followed by a vote of stakeholders on whether to proceed. Ask the right question, whether the project is worthwhile, not the wrong question of what paperwork is in order.\nThis post is not about laying out that procedure. This post is mostly about telling various Tales From the NEPA. It is also telling tales of energy generation from around the world, including places that do not share our full madness.\nVersions and components of this post have been in my drafts for a long time, so not all of them will be as recent as is common here.\nThe Other Full NEPA Solution\nThat was the plan, but the vibes have changed, and NEPA is pretty clearly a large net negative for climate change, which has to win in a fight at this point over the local concerns it protects. There’s a new plan.\nKill it. Repeal NEPA. Full stop.\nEmmett Shear: Previously I believed that there was probably enough protection offered by NEPA / CEQA that it offset the damage. At this point, it’s pretty clear we should simply repeal it and figure out if we need to replace anything later.\nRepeal NEPA.\nEli Dourado: NEPA is the most harmful law in the United States and must be repealed. In addition to causing forest fires and miring Starbase in litigation, it results in delays and endless litigation for any project that the federal government touches. It should be target #1 for DOGE.\nSadly this is not yet within the Overton window of relevant Congressional staff. We need to make this happen.\n\nThe problem is DOGE is working via cutting off payments, which doesn’t let you hit NEPA. But if you want to strike a blow that matters? This is it.\nMeanwhile\nThomas Hochman: Trump has revoked Carter’s 1977 EO – the one that empowered CEQ to issue binding NEPA regulations.\nThis could dramatically reshape how federal agencies conduct NEPA reviews. In the post-Marin Audobon landscape, this is a HUGE deal!\n…\nLet’s walk through a few of the specifics.\nCEQ will formally propose repealing the existing NEPA regulations that have guided agencies since the late 1970s.\nThis is major: those regs currently supply the standard NEPA procedures (e.g., EIS format, “major federal action,” significance criteria, scoping, etc.).\nRescinding them will leave agencies free to adopt leaner, agency-specific processes—or rely on new guidance.\nCEQ will lead a “working group” composed of representatives from various agencies.\nThis group’s job is to develop or revise each agency’s own NEPA procedures so that they’re consistent with the new (post-rescission) approach.\nAs I wrote in Green Tape, establishing this internal guidance at the agency level will be crucial.\nAnd finally: general permits and permits-by-rule!!!\nEli Dourado: NEPA is still there but CEQ’s authority to issue regs is gone (and was already under dispute in the courts). NEPA the statute still applies.\nCremieux: Some pretty major components of permitting reform on day one might be the biggest news in the day one EOs.\nThere’s trillions in value in these EOs.\nI am delighted.\n\nYou love to see it. This day one move gave me a lot of hope things would go well, alas other things happened that were less good for my hopes.\nAs with everything Trump Administration, we will see what actually happens once the lawyers get involved. This is not an area where ‘ignore the law and simply do things’ seems likely to work out. Some of it will stick, but how much?\n\n\n\n \n \n \nYay Nuclear Power\nYay nuclear deregulation, yes obviously, Alex Tabarrok opens with ‘yes, I know how that sounds’ but actually it sounds great if you’re familiar with the current regulations. I do see why one would pause before going to the level of ‘treat small modular reactors like x-ray machines,’ I’d want to see the safety case and all that, but probably.\nNuclear is making an attempted comeback, now that AI and trying the alternative of doing nothing has awoken everyone to the idea that this will be a good idea.\nAlexander Kaufman: The Senate voted nearly unanimously (88-2) to pass major legislation designed to reverse the American nuclear industry’s decades-long decline and launch a reactor-building spree to meet surging demand for green electricity at home and to catch up with booming rivals overseas.\nThe bill slashes the fees the Nuclear Regulatory Commission charges developers, speeds up the process for licensing new reactors and hiring key staff, and directs the agency to work with foreign regulators to open doors for U.S. exports.\nThe NRC is also tasked with rewriting its mission statement to avoid unnecessarily limiting the “benefits of nuclear energy technology to society,” essentially reinterpreting its raison d’être to include protecting the public against the dangers of not using atomic power in addition to whatever safety threat reactors themselves pose.\n\nThere is a lot of big talk about how much this will change the rules on nuclear power regulation. As usual I remain skeptical of big impacts, but it would not take much to reach a tipping point. As the same post notes when discussing the reactors in Georgia, once you relearn what you are doing things get a lot better and cheaper.\nThat pair of reactors, which just came online last month at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, cost more than $30 billion. As the expenses mounted, other projects to build the same kind of reactor elsewhere in the country were canceled.\nThe timing could hardly have been worse. After completing the first reactor, the second one cost far less and came online faster. But the disastrous launch dissuaded any other utilities from investing in a third reactor, which economists say would take even less time and money now that the supply chains, design and workforce are established.\n\nAfter seeing the results, the secretary of energy called for ‘hundreds’ more large nuclear reactions, two hundred by 2050.\nNextEra looking to restart a nuclear plant in Iowa that closed in 2020.\nOntario eyeing a new nuclear plant near Port Hope, 8-10 GWs.\nIt seems the world is a mix of people who shut down nuclear power out of spite and mood affiliation and intuitions that nuclear is dangerous or harmful when it is orders of magnitudes safer and fully green, versus those who realize we should be desperate to build more.\nMatthew Yglesias: The all-time energy champ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Yglesias: The Fukushima incident was deadly not because anyone died in the accident but because the post-Fukushima nuclear shutdown caused more Japanese people to freeze to death to conserve energy.\n\nDean Ball is excited by the bill, including its prize for next-gen nuclear tech and the potential momentum for future action.\nThere is a long way to go. It seems we do things like this? And the lifetime for nuclear power plants has nothing to do with their physical capabilities or risks?\nAlec Stapp: Apparently we have been arbitrarily limiting licenses for nuclear power reactors to 40 years because of… “antitrust considerations”??\nNuclear Regulatory Commission: The Atomic Energy Act authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue licenses for commercial power reactors to operate for up to 40 years. These licenses can be renewed for an additional 20 years at a time. The period after the initial licensing terris known as the period of extended operation. Economic and antitrust considerations, not limitations of nuclear technology, determined the original 40-year term for reactor licenses. However, because of this selected time period, some systems, structures, and components may have been engineered on the basis of an expected 40-year service life.\n\nOr how many nuclear engineers does it take to change a light bulb? $50k worth.\nHow much for a $200 panel meter in a control room? Trick question, it’s $20k.\nAnd yet nuclear is still at least close to cost competitive.\nThe Senate also previously forced Biden to drop attempt to renominate Jeff Baran to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the the basis of Baran being starkly opposed to the concept of building nuclear power plants.\nWhy has Biden effectively opposed nuclear power? My model is that it is the same reason he is effectively opposing power transmission and green energy infrastructure. Biden thinks throwing money and rhetoric at problems makes solutions happen. He does not understand, even in his best moments, that throwing up or not removing barriers to doing things stops those things from happening even when that was not your intention.\nThus, he can also do things like offer $1.5 billion in conditional commitments to support recommissioning a Michigan nuclear power plant, because he understands that more nuclear power plants would be a good thing. And he can say things like ‘White House to support new nuclear power plants in the U.S.’ That does not have to cause him to, in general, do the things that cause there to be more nuclear power plants. Because he cannot understand that those are things like ‘appoint people to the NRC that might ever want to approve a new nuclear power plant in practice.’ Luckily, it sounds like the new bill does indeed help.\nSmall modular nuclear reactor (SMR) planned for Idaho, called most advanced in the nation, was cancelled in January after customers could not be found to buy the electricity. Only a few months later, everyone is scrambling for more electricity to run their data centers. It seems like if you build it, Microsoft or Google or Amazon will be happy to plop a data center next to that shiny new reactor, no? And certainly plenty of other places would welcome one. So odd that this got slated first for Idaho.\nAlberta signs deal to jointly assess the development and deployment of SMRs. One SMR is to be built in Ontario by end of 2028, to be online in 2029.\nSlovakia to build a new nuclear reactor. Also talk of increased capacity in France, Italy, Britain, Japan, Canada, Poland and The Netherlands in the thread, from May. From December 2023: Poland authorizes 24 new small nuclear plants.\nPhilippines are considering nuclear as well.\nSupport for Nuclear in Australia has increased dramatically to 61%-37%.\nClaim that the shutdown of nuclear power in Germany was even more corrupt than we realized, with the Green Party altering expert conclusions to stop a reconsideration. The claims have been denied.\nUnfortunately, we are allowing an agreement whereby Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) will not be allowed to bid on new nuclear projects in Western countries, due to an IP issue with Westinghouse, on top of them paying royalties for any Asian projects that move forward. The good news is that if Westinghouse wins the projects, KHNP and KEPCO are prime sub-contractors anyway, so it is unclear this is that much of a functional\nYay Solar and Wind Power\nIndia’s energy mix is rapidly improving.\nJohn Raymond Hanger: Good morning with good news: Solar and wind were 92% of India’s generation additions in 2022. It deployed as much solar in 2022 as the UK has ever built. Coal also was down 78%.\nIndia’s large wind & solar additions are vital climate action. Wonderful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Bryan: Confusingly written. Coal in India is at 55%. Wind is at 10% & solar is at 12% – sometimes more, sometimes less.\nA Zaugurz: mmmkay “India has an estimated 65.3 GW of proposed, on-grid coal capacity under active development: 30.4 GW under construction and 34.9 GW in pre-construction”\n\n\n\n\nStocks are different from flows are different from changes in flow.\nIndia was still adding more coal capacity even as of December. But almost all of their new capacity was Solar and Wind, and they are clearly turning the corner on new additions. One still has to then make emissions go down, and then make net emissions drop below zero. One step at a time.\nAlso, 15% of the installed base is already not bad at all. Renewables are a big deal. A shame nuclear is only 2%.\nKhavda in India, now the world’s largest renewable energy park using a combination of solar and wind energy.\nBack in America, who is actually building the most solar?\nWhy, Texas, of course. California talks a good game, but what matters most (aside from sunlight where California has the edge) is not getting in the way.\nEIAGov: More than half of the new utility-scale solar capacity scheduled to come online in 2024 is planned for three states: Texas (35%), California (10%) and Florida (6%).\nAlec Stapp: Blue states talk a big game on clean energy goals while Texas just goes and builds it.\nTexas is building grid-scale solar at a much faster rate than California.\nCan’t be due to regulations — must be because CA is a small state with little sunshine \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers mean that despite being the state with at least the third most sunlight after Arizona and New Mexico, California is bringing online solar per capita than the nation overall.\nIf you want to install home solar, it is going to get expensive in the sense that the cost of the panels themselves is now less than 10% of your all-in price.\nYay Grid Storage\nPatrick Collison: Grid storage to grow 80% in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great start, but still a drop in the bucket, as I understand it, compared to what we will need if we intend to largely rely on solar and wind in the future.\nYay Transmission Lines\nOne enemy of transmission lines and other grid capabilities are NIMBYs who block projects. This includes the projects that never get proposed because of anticipation that they would then be blocked, or would require time and money to not be blocked.\nTyler Cowen reprints an anonymous email he got, that notes that there is also an incentive problem.\nWhen you increase power transmission capacity, you make power fungible between areas. Which is good, unless you are in the power selling business, in which case this could mean more competition and less profit. By sticking to smaller local projects, you can both avoid scrutiny and mostly get the thing actually built, and also avoid competition.\nThat makes a lot of sense. It suggests we need to look at who is tasked with building new transmission lines, and who should be bearing the costs, including the need to struggle to make the plans and ensure they actually happen.\nAmerican Energy is Cheap\nWhy do we produce so little energy in America? Partly because it is so cheap.\nAlex Tabarrok: The US has some of the lowest electricity prices in the world. Shown below are industrial retail electricity prices in EU27, USA, UK, China and Japan. Electricity is critical for AI compute, electric cars and more generally reducing carbon footprints. The US needs to build much more electricity infrastructure, by some estimates tripling or quadrupling production. That’s quite possible with deregulation and permitting reform. I am pleased to learn, moreover, that we are starting from a better base than I had imagined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing how much prices elsewhere have risen lately, and how timid has been everyone’s response.\nGeoengineering\nHarvard was going to do something useful and run a geoengineering experiment. They cancelled it, because of course they did. And their justifications were, well…\nJames Temple (MIT Technology Review): Proponents of solar geoengineering research argue we should investigate the concept because it may significantly reduce the dangers of climate change. Further research could help scientists better understand the potential benefits, risks and tradeoffs between various approaches.\nBut critics argue that even studying the possibility of solar geoengineering eases the societal pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaxwell Tabarrok: The moral hazard argument against geoengineering is ridiculous. The central problem of climate change is that firms ignore the cost of carbon emissions.\nSince these costs are already ignored, decreasing them will not change their actions, but it will save lives.\n\nIt is difficult to grasp how horrible this reasoning actually is. I can’t even. Imagine this principle extended to every other bad thing.\nYes, actually implementing such solutions comes with a lot of costs and dangers. That makes it seem like a good idea to learn now what those are via experiments? Better to find out now than to wait until the crisis gets sufficiently acute that people or nations get desperate?\nThe alternative hypothesis is that many people who claim to care about the climate crisis are remarkably uninterested in the average temperatures in the world not going up. We have a lot of evidence for this hypothesis.\n \n \n \nNEPA Standard Procedure is a Doom Loop\nIt goes like this.\nChris Elmendorf: A $650m project would:\n– subtract 20 acres from wildlife refuge\n– add 35 acres to same refuge\n– connect 160 renewable energy projects to grid\nNot with NEPA + local enviros standing in the way. Even after “years” of enviro study.\nKevin Stevens: An environmental group successfully blocked the last miles of a nearly complete 102 mile transmission line that would connect 160 renewable sites to the Midwest. Brutal.\n\nI mean it’s completely insane that we would let 20 acres stop this at all, the cost/benefit is so obviously off the charts even purely for the environmental impacts alone. But also they are adding 35 other acres. At some point, you have to wonder why you are negotiating with people who are never willing to take any deal at all.\nThe answer is, you are forced to ‘negotiate,’ they pretend to do so back, you give them concessions like the above, and then they turn around and keep suing, with each step adding years of delay. The result is known as a ‘doom loop.’\nClean energy projects are the very projects most likely to get stuck in the litigation doom loop. A recent Stanford study found that clean energy projects are disproportionately subject to the strictest level of review. These reviews are also litigated at higher rates — 62% of the projects currently pending the strictest review are clean energy projects. The best emissions modelers show that our emissions reductions goals are not possible without permitting reform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is why we’re proposing a time limit on injunctions. Under our proposal, after four years of litigation and review, courts could no longer prevent a project from beginning construction. This solution would pair nicely with the two-year deadlines imposed on agencies to finish review in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. If the courts believe more environmental review is necessary, they could order the government to perform it, but they could no longer paralyze new energy infrastructure construction.\n\nThis kills projects, and not the ones you want to kill. I am actually surprised the graph here lists rates that are this low.\n\n\n\n\nIf we are not going to do any other modifications, a time limit on court challenges seems like the very least we can do. My preferred solution is to change the structure entirely.\n \n \nCategorical Exemptions\nThe good news is that some actions are exempt. But the exemptions are illustrative.\nThomas Hochman: Perhaps the funniest categorical exclusion under NEPA is the one that allows the Department of the Interior to make an arrest without filling out an environmental assessment.\nAlec Stapp: When everything qualifies as a “major federal action” under NEPA, you get absurd outcomes like this where agencies have to waste time creating categorical exclusions for every little thing.\nThis is how state capacity withers and dies.\n\n\n\nTeachers Against Transportation\nSo in practice, what does NEPA look like?\nCongestion Pricing in NYC was a case in point before Hochul betrayed us.\nIt looks like this, seriously, read how the UFT itself made its claims.\nUnited Federation of Teachers: In our lawsuit, we assert that this program, scheduled to go into effect this spring, cannot be put in place without the completion of a thorough environmental impact statement that includes the potential effects of the plan on the city’s air quality.\n\n\n\n\nIn our lawsuit, we assert that this program, scheduled to go into effect this spring, cannot be put in place without the completion of a thorough environmental impact statement that includes the potential effects of the plan on the city’s air quality.\n\n\n\n\nThe current plan would not eliminate air and noise pollution or traffic, but would simply shift that pollution and traffic to the surrounding areas, particularly Staten Island, the Bronx, upper Manhattan and Northern New Jersey, causing greater environmental injustice in our city.\n[Copy of lawsuit here.]\nEmmett Shear: This NYC teacher’s union in suing to stop congestion pricing by using a claims that it will somehow have a negative impact on the environment when fewer people drive into the city. Truly extraordinary.\nJoey Politano: “Teachers Union Sues NYC Over Congestion Pricing Proposal’s Lack of Thorough Environmental Review” would almost be too on the nose for an Onion headline about the problems with American transit & environmental policy, and yet here we are.\nAlec Stapp: NYC teachers union claims the environmental review for congestion pricing wasn’t thorough enough. Actual photo of the 4,000-page environmental review:\n\n\n\n\nAlec Stapp: Reminder that congestion pricing was passed by the democratically-elected state legislature in 2019. Vetocracy is bad.\n\nThat’s right. Reducing the use of cars via congestion pricing has been insufficiently studied in case it causes air pollution in other areas, and would cause ‘injustice.’ And the review pictured above means they did not take review seriously, it’s not enough.\nIt is amazing to me we put up with such nonsense.\nAlternatively, it looks similar to this, technically the National Historic Preservation Act:\nAP: Tribes, environmental groups ask US court to block $10 billion energy transmission project in Arizona.\nAlec Stapp: The biggest clean energy project in the country is being sued by environmental groups.\nThis outdated version of “environmentalism” needs to die.\nIt’s time to build, not block.\nThe project is being sued under the National Historic Preservation Act. The NHPA is possibly the second most abused law in this space (the first being NEPA).\nThis is the last thing you see before your clean energy project gets sued into oblivion.\nSame group sues to block geothermal project [in Nevada.]\n\n\n\n\nHere we have a lithium mine and a geothermal project in California, and conservation groups once again are suing.\nE&E News: Environmental groups on Thursday sued officials who signed off on a lithium project in the Salton Sea that a top Biden official has helped advance.\nComité Civico del Valle and Earthworks filed the legal complaint in Imperial County Superior Court against county officials who approved conditional permits for Controlled Thermal Resources’ Hell’s Kitchen lithium and geothermal project.\nThe groups argue that the country’s approval of the direct lithium extraction and geothermal brine project near the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea violates county and state laws, such as the California Environmental Quality Act.\nAlec Stapp: Conservation groups suing to stop a lithium and geothermal project in California. Yet another example of conservation groups at direct odds with climate goals. Clean energy deployment requires building stuff in the real world, full stop.\nArmand Domalewski: so so so many environmental groups are just climate arsonists\n\nAnd by rule of three, the kicker:\nThomas Hochman: This is the most classic NEPA story of all time: The US Forest Service wanted to implement a wildfire prevention plan, so it had to fill out an environmental impact statement. Before they could complete the environmental impact statement, though, half the forest burned down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Lincicome: 10/10. no notes. A little googling here reveals the kicker: the appellant apparently filed the appeal/complaint to protect the forest (a goshawk habitat)… that subsequently burned down bc of her appeal/complaint.\n\n \nAlso CEQA\nCEQA is like NEPA, only it is by California, and it is even worse.\nDan Federman: It breaks my brain that NIMBYs have succeeded in blocking coastal wind farms that aren’t visible from shore, but yet Santa Barbara somehow has oil rigs visible from its gorgeous beaches \nMax Dubler: You have to understand that California environmental law is chiefly concerned with *preserving the environment that existed in 1972,* not protecting nature. For example, oil companies sued under environmental law to block LA’s ban on oil drilling.\nAlex Armlovich: According to CEQA, the California Environment of 1970 Quality Act, removing the oil derricks for renewables would impact the visual & cultural resources of this historic beach drilling site\nYears of study & litigation needed to protect our heritage drilling environment \n\nHere is one CEQA issue. This also points out that you can write in all the exemptions you want, and none of that will matter unless those in charge actually use them.\nAlec Stapp: Environmental review is now holding up ***bus shelters*** by six months. Literally can’t even build the smallest physical infrastructure quickly.\nChris Elmendorf: Why is LA’s transit agency cowering before NIMBYs rather than invoking the new @Scott_Wiener-authored CEQA exemption for transit improvements?\nBus stops certainly would seem to meet SB 922’s definition of “transit prioritization project,” which includes “transit stop access and safety improvement.”\nBut instead of invoking the exemption, the city prepared a CEQA “negative declaration,” which is the most legally vulnerable kind of CEQA document.\nIt looks like city’s neg dec was made just months prior to effective date of SB 922. So what? City could have approved an exemption too as soon as SB 922 took effect.\nOr city could approve it tomorrow.\nRather than putting bus shelters on hold just b/c a lawsuit was filed.\nHalting transit projects just b/c a lawsuit was filed seems especially dumb at the present moment, when Leg has made clear it wants these projects streamlined and elite/journalist opinion has turned against CEQA abuse.\nIf a court dared to enjoin the project, there’d be uproar & Leg would probably respond by strengthening the transit exemption.\nJust look at what the NIMBYs “won” by stopping 500 apartments on a valet parking lot in SF (AB 1633), or student housing in Berkeley (AB 1307).\nIs this just a case of bureaucratic risk aversion (@pahlkadot) or autopiloting of dumb processes? Is there an actual problem with SB 922 that makes it unusable for ordinary LA bus stops?\nCurious to hear from anyone who knows.\n\nMy presumption is it is basically autopiloting, that the people who realize it is dumb do not have the reach to the places where people don’t care. It is all, of course, madness.\nThe good news is that the recent CEQA ruling says that it should no longer give the ‘fullest possible protection’ to everything, so things should get somewhat better.\nI wish this number were slightly higher for effect, but still, seriously:\nR Street: 49% of CEQA lawsuits are against environmentally advantageous projects!\n\n\n\nIt Can Always Be Worse\nSomehow, rather than struggling to improve the situation, many Democrats seem to strive to make the inability to do things even worse.\nFor example, we have this thread from January detailing the proposed Clean Electricity Transmission Acceleration Act. Here are some highlights of an alternative even worse future, where anyone attempting to do anything is subject to arbitrary hold up for ransom, and also has to compensate any losers of any kind, including social and economic costs, and destroying any limitations on scope of issues. The bill even spends billions to fund these extractive oppositional efforts directly.\nChris Elmendorf: The bill defines “enviro impact” to include not only enviro impacts, but also “aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health” effects. (Whereas CEQA is still about “physical environment”–even in the infamous Berkeley case.\nThe bill creates utterly open-ended authority for fed. agencies to demand a “community benefit agreement” as price of any permit for which an EIS was prepared. This converts NEPA from procedural statute into grant of substantive reg / exaction authority.\nIn exercising the “community benefit agreement” authority, what is a federal agency supposed to consider? Consideration #1 is the deepness of the permit-applicant’s pocket. Seriously.\nAnd in case the new, expansive definition of “enviro impact” wasn’t clear enough, the bill adds that CBAs may be imposed to offset any *social or economic* (as well as enviro) impacts of the project.\nThe bill would also destroy the caselaw that limits scope of enviro review to scope of agency’s regulatory discretion, not only via the CBA provision but also by expressly requiring analysis of effects “not within control of any federal agency.”\nAnd the bill would send a torrent of federal dollars into the coffers of groups who’d exploit NEPA for labor or other side hustles. – there’s $3 billion of “community engagement” grants to arm nonprofits & others\n…\nAnd in case NEPA turned up to 11 isn’t enough, there’s also a new, judicially enforceable mandate for “community impact reports” if a project may affect an “environmental justice community.”\nThere’s also a wild provision that seems to prevent federal agencies from considering any project alternatives in an EIS unless (a) the alternative would have no adverse impact on any “overburdened community,” or (b) it serves a compelling interest *in that community.*\n…\nOne more observation: the bill subtly nudges NEPA toward super-statute status by directing conflicts b/t NEPA “and any other provision of law” to be resolved in favor of NEPA.\n\nOr we could have black-clad anarchists storming electric vehicle factories, as happened in Tesla’s plant in Berlin. Although we do have ‘Georgia greens’ suing over approval of an EV plant there.\nHow We Got Into This Mess\nIt turns out everyone basically let this mess happen because Congress wanted to get home for Christmas? No one understood what they were doing?\n\n\n\n\nThis seems like it should be publicized more, as part of the justification for killing this requirement outright, and finding a better way to accomplish the same thing. It is amazing how often the worst laws have origin stories like this.\nPatrick McKenzie: Sometimes we spend a trillion dollars because not spending a trillion dollars would require an exhausting amount of discussions and it is almost Christmas.\nPlease accept a trillion dollars as a handwavy gesture in the direction of the impact of NEPA; my true estimate if I gave myself a few hours to think would probably be higher.\n\nI know everyone says that once you pass a regulation it is almost impossible to remove. But what if… we… did it anyway?\nCategorical Exclusions\nIt is good that these exclusions are available. It is rather troublesome that they are so necessary?\nNicholas Bagley: A number of federal agencies have categorical exclusions from NEPA for … picnics.\nIf you need a special exception to make the lawyers comfortable with picnics, maybe you’ve gone too far?\n“29. Approval of recreational activities (such as Coast Guard unit picnic) which do not involve significant physical alteration of the environment, increase disturbance by humans of sensitive natural habitats, or disturbance of historic properties, and which do not occur in, or adjacent to, areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species.”\n\nI mean, modest proposal time, perhaps?\nIf your physical activity:\nDoes not significantly physically alter the environment.\nDoes not disturb sensitive natural habitats.\nDoes not disturb historic properties.\nDoes not occur in or adjacent to areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species.\nOr, actually, how about if your physical activity:\nDoes not significantly physically alter the environment.\nThen why are we not done? What is there we need to know, that this does not imply?\nShouldn’t we be able to declare this in a common sense way, and then get sued in court if it turns out we were lying or wrong, with penalties and costs imposed if someone sues in profoundly silly fashion, such as over a picnic?\nThe good news: We are getting some new ones.\nAlec Stapp: Huge permitting reform news:\nThe Bureau of Land Management is giving geothermal energy exploration a categorical exclusion from environmental review under NEPA.\nIf you care about clean energy abundance, this is a massive win.\nArnab Datta: ICMYI – great news, BLM is adopting categorical exclusions to streamline permitting for geothermal exploration.\nWhat’s the upshot? Exploration for geothermal resources should be a little bit easier.\nAs a result of the FRA (passed last year), agencies can now more easily adopt the categorical exclusions of other agencies. That’s what BLM is doing, adopting the CXs from the Navy and USFS.\nEx: Here’s the Navy CX. Applications to BLM for geophysical surveys will be easier.\nWhy is this important? BLM (and the federal government writ-large) owns a LOT of land, particularly in the Mountain West where heat resources are strongest, most ripe for geothermal production.\nWe previously recommended that BLM expand its CXs for geothermal exploration. This is a great first step, but there’s more to do.\nPatrick McKenzie: I’ve been doing some work with a geothermal non-profit, and my inexpert understanding is that while first-of-their-kind projects are the immediate blocker, NEPA lawsuits were a major worry with expanding rollout to blue states after proof of concepts get accomplished and tweaked.\nThe (without loss of generality) Californias of the world are huge energy consumers, cannot simply import electricity from (without loss of generality) Texas (though you can tweak that assumption a tiny bit on margins), and local organized political opposition is a real factor.\nIf you’re curious as to why geothermal is likely to be a much larger part of U.S. and world energy mixes than you model currently, see this.\nShort version: fracking makes it viable in many more places than it is currently.\n\nThere is a lot more to do on the exclusion front. It seems like obvious low-hanging fruit to exclude as many green projects as possible. Yes, this suggests the laws are bad and should be replaced entirely, but until then we work with the system we have.\nAlec Stapp: Other federal agencies should start thinking about how to use categorical exclusions from NEPA environmental review to make it easier to build in the US.\nHere’s some low-hanging fruit:\n@HUDgov should update its categorical exclusion to cover office-to-residential conversions.\n\n\n\n\nThat seems like it should fall under ‘wait why do we even need an exclusion again?’\nAnd that’s not all.\nAlec Stapp: Good news on permitting reform!\nThe Department of Energy is giving a categorical exclusion from NEPA environmental review to:\n– transmission projects that use existing rights of way\n– solar projects on disturbed lands\n– energy storage projects on disturbed lands\nSam Drolet: This is huge. It’s good to see agencies starting to use categorical exclusions in a sensible way to streamline permitting.\nChristian Fong: A lot of great rules coming out right now from the Biden admin, but one that has gone under the radar is on NEPA reforms from the DOE! Specifically, expanding the list of projects that qualify for categorical exclusions, which can speed up NEPA reviews from 2 years to 2 months!\n,,,\nFor solar, CXes were initially granted only if projects were built in a previously disturbed/developed land and were under 10 acres in size. This rule has removed the acreage limit, so that even projects 1000+ acres in size can still qualify if on previously disturbed lands.\nA new CX was established for storage, with similar qualifications around previously disturbed/developed land, as well as the ability for projects to use a small bit of contiguous undisturbed land, as storage may be colocated with existing energy/tx/industry infrastructure.\n…\nGiven full NEPA EISes can take 2 years, and new tx lines can take 10+ years to build, these rules are particularly important for improving tx capacity through reconductoring, GETs, etc. DOE just released its liftoff report on this topic here.\n\n \nA Green Bargain\nA new paper suggested a ‘a green bargain’ could be struck on permitting reform, that is a win for everyone. It misunderstands what people are trying to win.\nZachary Liscow: NEW PAPER: “Getting Infrastructure Built: The Law and Economics of Permitting,” on:\n– What to consider in design of permitting rules\n– The evidence\n– A possible “green bargain” that benefits efficiency, the environment, & democracy\n…\nInfrastructure is often slowed by permitting rules. One example is NYC congestion pricing, which was passed by the legislature in 2019, had a 4,000-page environmental assessment, and is now subject to 5 lawsuits.\nBut how can we speed up permitting and make infrastructure less expensive, while still protecting the environment and promoting democratic participation?\n…\nEnvironmental permitting might be part of why infrastructure is so expensive in the US. Urban transit costs about 3x the rich/middle-income country average and 6x some European countries.\n…\nAt the same time, US environmental outcomes aren’t particularly good. Based on the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy’s Environmental Performance Index, the US (at 51, just the 25thpercentile) is considerably worse than the OECD average (at 58).\n…\nSo what to do? I have a framework w/ 2 dimensions. 1: Improve the capacity of the executive to decide – for example, by limiting the power of litigation to delay. 2: Improve the capacity to plan, including by adding broad-based participation. Currently the US is weak along both.\nI propose a “green bargain” that strengthens both executive power and capacity, empowering the executive to decide, but coupling that w/ increased capacity to plan, especially in ways that promote broad-based participation.\n\nCan we create a win-win-win for:\nEfficiency\nDemocracy\nThe Environment?\nYes, most certainly, in a big way. The current system is horribly inefficient in many ways that benefit neither democracy nor the environment, indeed frequently this problem is harmful to both. If these are the stakeholders, then there any number of reasonable ‘good governance’ plans one could use.\nSo what is the deal proposed? As far as I can tell it is this:\nIncrease executive power over decisions.\nRise standards required for judicial review and make court challenges harder in various ways – time limits, standing requirements, limits on later new objections, limits on challenges to negotiated agreements, more categorical exclusions.\nLimits on court injunctions to stop projects.\nIncrease executive capacity on all levels of government so they can handle it.\nImprove quality and scope of executive reviews and enhance public participation.\nDo I support all of these proposals on the margin? Absolutely. Most would be good individually, the rest make sense as part of the package.\nDo I think that this should be convincing to a sincere environmentalist, that they should trust that this will lead to good outcomes? Alas, my answer is essentially no, if this was applied universally.\nI do think this should be convincing if it is applied exclusively to green energy projects and complementary infrastructure. If the end goal is solar panels or batteries, and one believes there is a climate crisis, then one should have a strong presumption that this should dominate local concerns and that delays and cost overruns kill projects.\nHere is the other core problem: Many obstructionists do not want better outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nOr in other words:\n\n\n\n\nIf someone’s goal is to accomplish good things that make life better, such as reducing how much carbon is in the atmosphere or ensuring the air and water are clean, and is willing to engage in trade to make the world improve and not boil, but has different priorities and weightings and values than you have?\nThen you can and should engage in trade, talk price. We can make a deal.\nIf someone’s goal is to stop development and efficiency because they believe development and efficiency are bad, either locally or globally? If they think humanity and civilization (or at least your civilization) are bad and want them to suffer and repent? Or consider every downside a sacred value that should veto any action?\nIf they actively do not want the problem solved because they want to use the problem as leverage to demand other things, and you are not a fan of those other things?\nThen you are very much out of luck. There is no deal.\nMy expectation is that even if your deal is a clear win for people and the environment, in way they can trust, you are going to get a lot of opposition from environmental groups anyway. Here, I worry that this proposal also does not give them sufficient reason to trust. Half the time the executive will be a Republican.\nThere is also this issue:\nJohn Arnold: I used to think decarbonization was hard because voters prioritized the goals of the energy system in the following order:\nAffordable\nReliable\nSecure\nClean\nBut I missed one. The actual order of prioritization is:\nJobs\nAffordable\nReliable\nSecure\nClean\nThat, however infuriating, is something we can work with. There is no inherent conflict between jobs and energy. It trades off with affordable, but we can talk price.\nCosts Versus Benefits\nI have so had it with all the ‘yes this saves the Earth but think of the local butterfly species’ arguments, not quite literally this case but yeah, basically.\nAlec Stapp: Very funny to me that the framing of this NYT article is sincerely like:\n“What’s more important: Saving earth or satisfying the idiosyncratic preferences of a small handful of activists?”\nThat’s not a close call!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nA Call for Proposals\nAct fast, this closes July 15: Introducing the Modernizing NEPA Challenge.\nIn alignment with ongoing efforts at DOT to improve the NEPA process, this Modernizing NEPA Challenge seeks:\nTo encourage project sponsors to publish documents associated with NEPA that increase accessibility and transparency for the public, reviewing agencies, and historically under-represented populations and\nTo incentivize project sponsors to implement collaborative, real-time agency reviews to save time and improve the quality of documents associated with NEPA.\nMore details at the link. The goal is to get collaborative tools and documents, and interactive documents, that make it easier to navigate the NEPA process.\nThe Men of Two Studies\nThomas Hochman: Almost every pro-NEPA argument can be traced back to two studies: Adelman’s “Permitting Reform’s False Choice” and Ruple’s “Measuring the NEPA Litigation Burden.”\nToday on Green Tape, we take a closer look at both studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the majority of the pie is green, as in clearly net good for the planet, even if you take the position that fossil fuels are always bad – and I’d argue the opposite, that anything replacing coal on the margin is obviously net good too.\nRuple’s study analyzes 1,499 federal court opinions involving NEPA challenges from 2001-2013. He comes up with two key findings:\nOnly about 0.22% of NEPA decisions (1 in 450) face legal challenges\nLess than 1% of NEPA reviews are environmental impact statements (EISs), and about 5% of NEPA reviews are environmental assessments (EAs).\n…\nBut in “Measuring the NEPA Litigation Burden,” Ruple makes the same error that he’s made throughout his work on permitting: he takes the average volume of litigation across all NEPA reviews and makes a conclusion about NEPA’s impact on infrastructure in particular. In other words, his denominator is wildly inflated.\nRuple’s dataset includes NEPA reviews at every level of stringency: categorical exclusions (CatExes), EAs, and EISs. And as Ruple himself points out, around 95% of NEPA reviews are CatExes. This is because NEPA is triggered by almost every federal action, and thus CatExes are required for everything from federal hiring to, yes, picnics.\n…\nTheir findings are remarkable: solar, pipeline, wind, and transmission projects saw litigation rates of 64%, 50%, 38%, and 31% respectively. The cancellation rates for each of these project types were also extraordinarily high, ranging from 12% to 32%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarring a rebuttal I do not expect, that seems definitive to me.\nWhat about the other study?\nThe basic flaw in Adelman’s analysis is that he sees the low percentage of renewable projects that undergo NEPA as evidence that NEPA isn’t a big deal. In reality, the exact opposite is true.\n\nAs in, NEPA is so obnoxious that where there would be NEPA issues, the projects never even get proposed. We only get renewable projects, mostly, where they have sufficient protections from this. Again, this seems definitive to me.\nA Modest Proposal\nMy grand solution to NEPA would be to repeal the paperwork and impact statement requirements, and replace them with a requirement for cost-benefit analysis. That is a complex proposal that I am confident would work if done properly, but which I agree is tricky.\nThe grander, simpler solution is repeal NEPA first and ask questions later. At this point, I think that’s the play.\nA solution in bewteen those two would perhaps be to change the remedy for failure, so that any little lapse does not stop an entire project.\nThis is another approach to the fundamental problem of sacred values versus cost-benefit.\nRight now, we are essentially saying that a wide variety of potential harms are sacred values, that we would not compromise at any price, such that if there is any danger that they might be compromised then that is a full prohibition.\nBut of course that is crazy. With notably rare exceptions, that is not how most anything should ever work.\nThus, an alternative solution is to keep all the requirements in place, and allow all the lawsuits to proceed.\nBut we change the remedy from injunctions to damages.\nAs in, suppose a group sues you, and says that your project might violate some statute or do harm in some way. Okay, fine. They file that claim, it is now established. You can choose to wait until the claim is resolved, if the claim actually is big enough and plausible enough that you are worried they might win.\nOr, you can convince an insurance company to post a bond for you, covering the potential damages (and let’s say you can get dinged for double or triple the actual harms, more if you ‘did it on purpose’ and knew you were breaking the rules, in some sense, or something). So you can choose to do the project anyway, without a delay, and if it turns out you messed up or broke the rules and the bill comes due, then you have to pay that bill. And since it is a multiplier, everyone is still ahead.\n\nDiscuss",

(Note though that there are important and valid examples of near-circular arguments, such as proofs by induction, but this in not the topic of this current discussion.) \n\nHere are two analogies between proof methods and shapes. Circular arguments and circles. But \"near-circular arguments\" and induction is a new one to me. It makes sense: you are proving the same claim \"off by one\", and don't wind up where you started. Visually, we could view this as a spiral, infinitely repeating almost the near circular shape. Perhaps exactly, if it's a vertical spiral. Naturally, the next step is to ask what proof methods correspond to what shapes, and how well. \nOn which note, let's see which spiral fits induction better. The horizontal, growing spiral suggests a base case and an increase in size. But I prefer the vertical spiral, as it suggests the inductive step via its infinite repetition of the same step.  What makes these images works is that they convey a sense of motion, like that of the proof methods going through a space of propositions or concepts. I'm not sure if that's a necessary property of this game we're playing, but it feels sufficient. \n\nOK, now that that's settled, what about other proof methods? IMO the obvious next answer is diagonalization. The classic example of this technique is Cantor's diagonal proof that ℵ0<c. The usual visualization suggests a shape: infinitely many parallel horizontal lines stretching off to the right, with a diagonal slicing through them. Unfortunately, my doodle just doesn't match the kinaesthetic sense I get from diagonalization, the sense of iterating through a list of lists, grabbing the nth item, flipping it and appending. And the lines don't map to concepts. \n\nMy other doodles also failed to represent this. So let's move on. \nProof by analogy is now, for whatever reason, associated with maps to me. Perhaps it's the effect of reading Woit's amazing book on representation theory and physics. Anyway, a map is just an arrow, but I feel like a flat arrow doesn't quite do it for me. It's gotta be bending, as if it's jumping across the pond between two landmasses. But now it's thick with a knob at the end. Wizardly, yes, but inelegant. Points on the curve no longer feel like they map to concepts (forgetting about the fact the curve is continuous). But whatever, I'll say this is a kinaesthetic success. But if anyone has better ideas, I'm listening.\n\nWhat other proof methods suggest a shape? \n\nDiscuss",

      "title": "The Oracle's Gift",
      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8fxQaENNQaazYow9f/the-oracle-s-gift",
      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 8:13 PM GMT\n\nI have tried and failed many times to write a certain essay. With inspiration from Scott Alexander and Borges, I have reframed it as a story. That reframing has been productive, and leads to the following plot.\nThe setting is a medieval kingdom. Through circumstances not relevant to this plot, the kingdom’s leading scholar has become an oracle, who now knows everything that there is to know. The king orders that he be placed under house arrest, to avoid his being targeted by a rival kingdom, or his escape, or even his slipping and falling on his head. Only carefully vetted individuals can visit him for advice. The oracle receives this arrangement with benevolent indifference.\nThe king’s advisors ask the oracle for stately advice, on taxation and war, on relations with other kingdoms. But it is an ambitious merchant who one day chooses to pursue a different line of opportunity. He tells the oracle that he wants to create a tonic that will cure a common and deadly disease, so that he can sell it to doctors and patients across the kingdom. The oracle gives him instructions for what ingredients to collect and how to process them. His advice helps the merchant create a health treatment that works miraculously often. As the merchant produces and sells this medicine, he accumulates even more riches, and the oracle becomes even more renowned.\nDoctors throughout the kingdom come to learn from the oracle, to see how he was able to cure this disease. Most of them leave frustrated, telling others that the oracle can only speak of mysterious concepts such as “germs”. When pressed further, he can only link these concepts to other cryptic ideas like “proteins”, which are somehow linked to cattle, even though the disease is not caused by animals in any way. While most of these prospective students leave in pessimism that they can learn anything useful from the oracle, a few stay to study with him. The oracle does not object to this arrangement. Some of these students become adept healers on their own, while others abandon medicine and begin conducting studies with symbols that they cannot explain to their former colleagues.\nThe merchant is farsighted. He realizes that with the oracle’s instruction and his own resources, he can build things that the king could never imagine. He imagines palaces in the sky, using the stars as fuel. He imagines a farm that uses machines to produce food without human or animal power. He imagines horses that can travel fast enough to cross the kingdom in a day. He takes these visions to the oracle and asks for help in realizing them. The oracle accepts. The merchant hires thousands of artificers to carry out the oracle’s instructions, and they get to work on building the city of the future.\nAt this point, I can see two endings to this story. Initially, I conceived the oracle’s task as impossible. So I first imagined an ending where his help is insufficient. Components built in spring degrade by autumn, so that the artificers constantly have to return to the oracle for new consultations. Artificers come and go over the years, and each new person inherits a half-finished machine of such complexity that it takes years before they can understand everything they need to know in order to carry out the instructions. The project stagnates in perpetual memorylessness.\nAfter decades of this delay, the oracle passes away from old age. His passing destroys the merchant’s vision for the city of the future. Resolved to find a successor, the merchant travels across the kingdom to appeal to all of the oracle’s students, and offers them a lifetime of riches if they can finish their teacher’s work. A few of them show promise in how much of the oracle’s teachings they have grasped, but they readily admit that it will be decades before they are capable of continuing the project. The merchant does not have decades to offer them; he himself passes away within a few years of the oracle.\nWith no one to lead the work or provide the instructions, the city of the future is abandoned. The half-constructed machines and structures become objects of curiosity for scholars, who use them to learn more about the physical world. These learnings do advance society, but their contribution is meager compared to what the merchant had imagined.\nTo me, this ending reflects the story that flows most naturally from this premise. But when I challenged myself to conceive of success for the merchant’s project, I imagined an interesting scenario.\nIn this second ending, the oracle successfully sees the project through. The artificers’ hands and the merchant’s management move in accordance with his blueprints, and they do build a city that is more advanced than any cities of the past, and (though they do not know it yet) will be more advanced than any cities of the future, for another thousand years.\nBut nobody who lives in the city of the future understands it. They live as children, cradled by intelligent design. Their rooms are warmed and cooled by invisible force, their food is created and prepared by anonymous mechanisms, and their lights glow without fire. Visitors from around the world come to see this impossible city, only to be baffled that nobody in this city can tell them how it works.\nWhen the oracle eventually passes away, there is nobody who understands the city they live in. The oracle leaves behind detailed manuals on the complex maintenance required to keep the city functioning smoothly. An entire guild of artificers is trained using these manuals. They debate over its ambiguous terminology, over segments that appear to contradict each other, over situations that are not covered explicitly in the manuals. Over time, the manuals become scripture, the artificers become priests, the guild becomes a church, and the oracle becomes the city’s founding deity.\nEach new generation inherits unreplicable prosperity, and the city carries on in perfect constancy for many lifetimes.\nCross-posted from my substack.\n\nDiscuss",

If c=d, then a∙c=b∙d.\nWe've defined what it means for an equation to have a finite number of terms on one of the sides. We've never defined what it means for an equation to have an infinite number of terms. Do all those rules we have about equations apply to these infinite term equations too? \nIf 1+12+14+18+116+⋯=2 and 12+14+18+116+132+⋯=1, does 1 + 12+34+38+316+332+⋯=3?\nWhat about if we multiply the two together? Does (1+12+14+18+116+⋯)∙(12+14+18+116+132+⋯)=2∙1=2?\nWhat does it even mean to multiply two infinite sums together?\nTo answer all these questions we need to define everything in terms of things we already understand. Then we can try and prove properties about them.\nThe first step is to break our infinite terms into something that only has finite terms. To do that we stop talking about vague things like infinite sums, and start talking about sequences.\nA sequence is just a neverending list of numbers. 1,2,3,4... is a sequence, as is 1,4,9,16...\nMore formally it's a mapping from the positive integers to the reals[1]. If you tell me you have a sequence s, I need to be able to ask you what the 172nd element of s is, and you need to be able to answer me. We denote this as s172.\nIn our case, we can define a sequence:\nsumsn=∑nk=012k\nIn other words, for any integer n, the nth number in the sequence sums is the sum of the first n terms in  1+12+14+18+116+⋯=2. Now because we're only ever dealing with a finite number of terms, every member of this sequence is well defined.\nNow we want to define a property called convergence, and say that sums converges to 2. How might we define that?\nOur first attempt might be to say that:\n\nA sequence s converges to A if for all n, sn is always closer to A than sn−1.\n\nBut a bit of exploration proves that is totally insufficient - By that definition sums converges to 3, 17, and in fact any number greater than 2.\nSo let's try and address that in our next attempt:\n\nA sequence s converges to A if for all n, sn is always closer to A than sn−1, and sn eventually gets infinitely close to A.\n\nBut we can't just willy nilly throw around terms like infinitely close. We need to define convergence only in terms of things we already understand. What we want to express is that if you pick any value, the sequence eventually gets closer to A than that value. We can express that precisely as:\n\nA sequence s converges to A if for all n, sn is always closer to A than sn−1, and for any non-zero number ϵ, there is a number k, such that |A−sk|<ϵ[2].\n\nThat works for all the examples we've given so far. But it doesn't work for some other examples. What about:\nsinesn=sin(n)n\n\nWe definitely want to be able to express somehow that the value of this sequence is 0, but it doesn't fit our definition, since it doesn't continuously get closer to 0 it keeps on overshooting, but the amount it overshoots by keeps getting smaller.\nSo we need to loosen our criteria. Instead of requiring it to always get closer to A, we can say that for any number, the sequence needs to eventually get closer to A than that number, and stay there:\n\nA sequence s converges to A if for any non-zero number ϵ, there is an integer k, such that for all integers m, where = k\">m>=k,  |A−sm|<ϵ.\n\nAnd this is indeed the most common definition of convergence that mathematicians use.\nWith this tool we can now start to explore concrete questions about convergence.\nFor example lets define the sum of two series as follows:\ns3=s1+s2 if s3n=s1n+s2n.\nNow if s1 converges to A, and s2 converges to B, does s3 necessarily converge to A+B?\nWe can attempt to sketch out a proof:\n\nFor any nonzero number ϵ, there is a value k1 such that for all m≥k1, |s1m−A|<ϵ2 and a value k2 such that for all m≥k2, |s2m−B|<ϵ2. Without loss of generality[3], assume that k1≥k2. Then for all m≥k1, we have |(s1m+s2m)−(A+B)|≤|s1m−A|+|s2m−B|<ϵ2+ϵ2=ϵ.\n\nNot only does this prove that adding sequences works as we expect, it also hints that when we do so the resultant sequence converges nearly as fast as the slowest of the two constituent sequences. Convergence speeds are a relatively advanced topic, but you can bet that the first thing you'll do if you study it is try to define precisely what it means for a sequence to converge quickly or slowly.\nNow the usual notation for s converges to A is:\nlimn→∞sn=A\nHowever you'll sometimes see mathematicians skipping this notation. Instead of writing limn→∞∑nk=012k=2 they'll just write: ∑∞k=012k=2.\nWhat's going on here?\nFirstly Mathematicians are lazy, and since everyone who reads the second form will understand it means the same thing as the first, why bother writing it out in full?\nBut it's actually hinting at something deeper - when you work with limits of sums they often behave as though you literally are just adding an infinite number of terms. Manipulations like the one Euler used for the Basel problem often happen to work even though they aren't actually justified by our definitions, and this notation can give you the hint you need to attempt just such an \"illegal\" manipulation before you commit yourself to finding a full blown formal proof.\nLater mathematicians then discovered some of the conditions under which you can treat a limit as a normal sum, and so such loose notation can actually provide fertile ground for future mathematical discoveries. This isn't an isolated event - such formalisation of informal notation has been repeated across many disparate branches of mathematics.\n\n^\nIt doesn't have to be the reals - you could have a sequence of functions or shapes or whatever, but for our purposes it's the reals.\n\n^\nThose vertical lines mean the absolute value, which means to ignore whether the value is positive or negative. So |−3.4|=|3.4|=3.4. Here it's just used to express that Sk and A are less than ϵ distance apart, without specifying whether Sk is greater than or less than A.\n\n^\nWithout loss of generality is another way of saying that we're going to prove one scenario (here where k1≥k2), but the proof is identical in other scenarios (e.g. when  k1\">k2>k1) if you just switch the symbols around (so call S1 S2 and vice versa), so we don't want to repeat the proof multiple times for each scenario.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 7:38 PM GMT\n\nA punishment is when one agent (the punisher) imposes costs on another (the punished) in order to affect the punished's behavior. In a Society where thieves are predictably imprisoned and lashed, people will predictably steal less than they otherwise would, for fear of being imprisoned and lashed.\nPunishment is often imposed by formal institutions like police and judicial systems, but need not be. A controversial orator who finds a rock thrown through her window can be said to have been punished in the same sense: in a Society where controversial orators predictably get rocks thrown through their windows, people will predictably engage in less controversial speech, for fear of getting rocks thrown through their windows.\nIn the most basic forms of punishment, which we might term \"physical\", the nature of the cost imposed on the punished is straightforward. No one likes being stuck in prison, or being lashed, or having a rock thrown through her window.\nBut subtler forms of punishment are possible. Humans are an intensely social species: we depend on friendship and trade with each other in order to survive and thrive. Withholding friendship or trade can be its own form of punishment, no less devastating than a whip or a rock. This is called \"social punishment\".\nEffective social punishment usually faces more complexities of implementation than physical punishment, because of the greater number of participants needed in order to have the desired deterrent effect. Throwing a rock only requires one person to have a rock; effectively depriving a punishment-target of friendship may require many potential friends to withhold their beneficence.\nHow is the collective effort of social punishment to be coordinated? If human Societies were hive-minds featuring an Authority that could broadcast commands to be reliably obeyed by the hive's members, then there would be no problem. If the hive-queen wanted to socially punish Mallory, she could just issue a command, \"We're giving Mallory the silent treatment now\", and her majesty's will would be done.\nNo such Authority exists. But while human Societies lack a collective will, they often have something much closer to collective beliefs: shared maps that (hopefully) reflect the territory. No one can observe enough or think quickly enough to form her own independent beliefs about everything. Most of what we think we know comes from others, who in turn learned it from others. Furthermore, one of our most decision-relevant classes of belief concern the character and capabilities of other people with whom we might engage in friendship or trade relations.\nAs a consequence, social punishment is typically implemented by means of reputation: spreading beliefs about the punishment-target that merely imply that benefits should be withheld from the target, rather than by directly coordinating explicit sanctions. Social punishers don't say, \"We're giving Mallory the silent treatment now.\" (Because, who's we?) They simply say that Mallory is stupid, dishonest, cruel, ugly, &c. These are beliefs that, if true, imply that people will do worse for themselves by helping Mallory. (If Mallory is stupid, she won't be as capable of repaying favors. If she's dishonest, she might lie to you. If she's cruel ... &c.) Negative-valence beliefs about Mallory double as \"social punishments\", because if those beliefs appear on shared maps, the predictable consequence will be that Mallory will be deprived of friendship and trade opportunities.\nWe notice a critical difference between social punishments and physical punishments. Beliefs can be true or false. A rock or a jail cell is not a belief. You can't say that the rock is false, but you can say it's false that Mallory is stupid.\nThe linkage between collective beliefs and social punishment creates distortions that are important to track. People have an incentive to lie to prevent negative-valence beliefs about themselves from appearing on shared maps (even if the beliefs are true). People who have enemies whom they hate have an incentive to lie to insert negative-valence beliefs about their enemies onto the shared map (even if the beliefs are false). The stakes are high: an erroneously thrown rock only affects its target, but an erroneous map affects everyone using that map to make decisions about the world (including decisions about throwing rocks).\nIntimidated by the stakes, some actors in Society who understand the similarity between social and physical punishment, but don't understand the relationship between social punishment and shared maps, might try to take steps to limit social punishment. It would be bad, they reason, if people were trapped in a cycle of mutual recrimination of physical punishments. Nobody wins if I throw a rock through your window to retaliate for you throwing a rock through my window, &c. Better to foresee that and make sure no one throws any rocks at all, or at least not big ones. They imagine that they can apply the same reasoning to social punishments without paying any costs to the accuracy of shared maps, that we can account for social standing and status in our communication without sacrificing any truthseeking.\nIt's mostly an illusion. If Alice possesses evidence that Mallory is stupid, dishonest, cruel, ugly, &c., she might want to publish that evidence in order to improve the accuracy of shared maps of Mallory's character and capabilities. If the evidence is real and its recipients understand the filters through which it reached them, publishing the evidence is prosocial, because it helps people make higher-quality decisions regarding friendship and trade opportunities with Mallory.\nBut it also functions as social punishment. If Alice tries to disclaim, \"Look, I'm not trying to 'socially punish' Mallory; I'm just providing evidence to update the part of the shared map which happens to be about Mallory's character and capabilities\", then Bob, Carol, and Dave probably won't find the disclaimer very convincing.\nAnd yet—might not Alice be telling the truth? There are facts of the matter that are relevant to whether Mallory is stupid, dishonest, cruel, ugly, &c.! (Even if we're not sure where to draw the boundary of dishonest, if Mallory said something false, and we can check that, and she knew it was false, and we can check that from her statements elsewhere, that should make people more likely to affirm the dishonest characterization.) Those words mean things! They're not rocks—or not only rocks. Is there any way to update the shared map without the update itself being construed as \"punishment\"?\nIt's questionable. One might imagine that by applying sufficient scrutiny to nuances of tone and word choice, Alice might succeed at \"neutrally\" conveying the evidence in her possession without any associated scorn or judgment.\nBut judgments supervene on facts and values. If lying is bad, and Mallory lied, it logically follows that Mallory did a bad thing. There's no way to avoid that implication without denying one of the premises. Nuances of tone and wording that seem to convey an absence of judgment might only succeed at doing so by means of obfuscation: strained abuses of language whose only function is to make it less clear to the inattentive reader that the thing Mallory did was lying.\nAt best, Alice might hope to craft the publication of the evidence in a way that omits her own policy response. There is a real difference between merely communicating that Mallory is stupid, dishonest, cruel, ugly, &c. (with the understanding that other people will use this information to inform their policies about trade opportunities), and furthermore adding that \"therefore I, Alice, am going to withhold trade opportunities from Mallory, and withhold trade opportunities from those who don't withhold trade opportunities from her.\" The additional information about Alice's own policy response might be exposed by fiery rhetoric choices and concealed by more clinical descriptions.\nIs that enough to make the clinical description not a \"social punishment\"? Personally, I buy it, but I don't think Bob, Carol, or Dave do.\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fzMJDo3mdzFQdik4R/iabied-paradigm-confusion-and-overconfidence",
      "summary": "Published on October 8, 2025 7:19 PM GMT\n\nThis is a continuation of my review of IABIED. It's intended for\naudiences who already know a lot about AI risk debates. Please at least\nglance at my main layman-oriented\nreview\nbefore reading this.\nEliezer and Nate used to argue about AI risk using a paradigm that\ninvolved a pretty sudden foom, and which viewed values through a utility\nfunction lens. I'll call that the MIRI paradigm (note: I don't have a\ncomprehensive description of the paradigm). In IABIED, they've tried to\nadopt a much broader paradigm that's somewhat closer to that of more\nmainstream AI researchers. Yet they keep sounding to me like they're\nstill thinking within the MIRI paradigm.\nPredicting Progress\nMore broadly, IABIED wants us to believe that progress has been slow in\nAI safety. From IABIED's online\nresources:\nWhen humans try to solve the AI alignment problem directly ... the\nsolutions discussed tend to involve understanding a lot more about\nintelligence and how to craft it, or craft critical components of it.\nThat's an endeavor that human scientists have made only a small amount\nof progress on over the past seventy years. The kinds of AIs that can\npull off a feat like that are the kinds of AIs that are smart enough\nto be dangerous, strategic, and deceptive. This high level of\ndifficulty makes it extremely unlikely that researchers would be able\nto tell correct solutions from incorrect ones, or tell honest\nsolutions apart from traps.\nI'm not at all convinced that the MIRI paradigm enables a useful view\nof progress, or a useful prediction of the kinds of insights that are\nneeded for further progress.\nIABIED's position reminds me of Robin Hanson's AI Progress\nEstimate:\nI asked a few other folks at UAI who had been in the field for twenty\nyears to estimate the same things, and they roughly agreed -- about\n5-10% of the distance has been covered in that time, without\nnoticeable acceleration. It would be useful to survey senior experts\nin other areas of AI, to get related estimates for their areas. If\nthis 5-10% estimate is typical, as I suspect it is, then an outside\nview calculation suggests we probably have at least a century to go,\nand maybe a great many centuries, at current rates of progress.\nRobin wrote that just as neural network enthusiasts, who mostly gathered\nat a different conference, were noticing an important\nacceleration.\nI expect that Robin is correct that the research on which he based his\noutside view would have taken at least a century to reach human levels.\nOr as Claude puts it:\nThe real problem wasn't just selection bias but paradigm\nblindness. UAI folks were measuring progress toward human-level\nreasoning via elegant probabilistic models. They didn't anticipate\nthat \"brute force\" neural networks would essentially bypass their\nentire research program.\nThe research that the IABIED authors consider to be very hard has a\nsimilar flavor to the research that Robin was extrapolating.\nRobin saw Pearl's\nCausality as an\nimportant AI advance, whereas I don't see it as part of AI. IABIED\nseems to want more advances such as Logical\nInduction, which I'm\nguessing are similarly marginal to AI.\nSuperalignment\nThe parts of IABIED that ought to be most controversial are pages 189 to\n191, where they reject the whole idea of superalignment that AI\ncompanies are pursuing.\nIABIED claims that AI companies use two different versions of the\nsuperalignment idea: a weak one that only involves using AI to\nunderstand whether an AI is aligned, and a strong one which uses AI to\ndo all the alignment work.\nI'm disturbed to hear that those are what AI companies have in mind. I\nhope there's been some communication error here, but it seems fairly\nplausible that the plans of AI companies are this sketchy.\nWeak Superalignment\nIn the case of weak superalignment: We agree that a relatively\nunintelligent AI could help with \"interpretability research,\" as\nit's called. But learning to read some of an AI's mind is not a plan\nfor aligning it, any more than learning what's going on inside atoms\nis a plan for making a nuclear reactor that doesn't melt down.\nI find this analogy misleading. It reflects beliefs about what\ninnovations are needed for safety that are likely mistaken. I expect\nthat AI safety today is roughly at the stage that AI capabilities were\nat around 2000 to 2010: much more than half of the basic ideas that are\nneeded are somewhat well known, but we're missing the kind of evidence\nthat we need to confirm it, and a focus on the wrong paradigms makes it\nhard to notice the best strategy.\nIn particular, it looks like we're close enough to being able to\nimplement corrigibility that the largest obstacle involves being able to\nobserve how corrigible an AI is.\nInterpretability is part of what we might need to distinguish paradigms.\nStrong Superalignment\nI'm not going to advocate strong superalignment as the best strategy,\nbut IABIED dismisses it too confidently. They say that we \"can't trust\nan AI like that, before you've solved the alignment problem\".\nThere are a wide variety of possible AIs and methods of determining what\nthey can be trusted to do, in much the same way that there are a wide\nvariety of contexts in which humans can be trusted. I'm disappointed\nthat IABIED asserts an impossibility without much of an argument.\nI searched around, and the MIRI paper Misalignment and\nCatastrophe\nhas an argument that might reflect IABIED's reasoning:\nWe argue that AIs must reach a certain level of goal-directedness and\ngeneral capability in order to do the tasks we are considering, and\nthat this is sufficient to cause catastrophe if the AI is misaligned.\nThe paper has a coherent model of why some tasks might require\ndangerously powerful AI. Their intuitions about what kind of tasks are\nneeded bear little resemblance to my intuitions. Neither one of us seems\nto be able to do much better than reference class tennis at explaining\nwhy we disagree.\nAnother Version of Superalignment\nLet me propose a semi-weak version of superalignment.\nI like how IABIED divides intelligence into two concepts: prediction and\nsteering.\nI see strong hints, from how AI has been developing over the past couple\nof years, that there's plenty of room for increasing the predictive\nabilities of AI, without needing much increase in the AI's steering\nabilities.\nMuch of the progress (or do I mean movement in the wrong direction?)\ntoward more steering abilities has come from efforts that are\nspecifically intended to involve steering. My intuition says that AI\ncompanies are capable of producing AIs that are better at prediction but\nstill as myopic as the more myopic of the current leading AIs.\nWhat I want them to aim for is myopic AIs with prediction abilities that\nare superhuman in some aspects, while keeping their steering abilities\nweak.\nI want to use those somewhat specialized AIs to make better than human\npredictions about which AI strategies will produce what results. I\nenvision using AIs that have wildly superhuman abilities to integrate\nlarge amounts of evidence, while being at most human-level in other\naspects of intelligence.\nI foresee applying these AIs to problems of a narrower scope than\ninventing something comparable to nuclear physics.\nIf we already have the ideas we need to safely reach moderately\nsuperhuman AI (I'm maybe 75% confident that we do), then better\npredictions plus interpretability are roughly what we need to\ndistinguish the most useful paradigm.\nIABIED likens our situations to alchemists who are failing due to not\nhaving invented nuclear physics. What I see in AI safety efforts\ndoesn't look like the consistent failures of alchemy. It looks much\nmore like the problems faced by people who try to create an army that\nwon't stage a coup. There are plenty of tests that yield moderately\npromising evidence that the soldiers will usually obey civilian\nauthorities. There's no big mystery about why soldiers might sometimes\ndisobey. The major problem is verifying how well the training\ngeneralizes out of distribution.\nIABIED sees hope in engineering humans to be better than Pearl or von\nNeumann at generating new insights. Would Pearl+-level insights create\nimportant advances in preventing military coups? I don't know. But\nit's not at all the first strategy that comes to mind.\nOne possible crux with superalignment is whether AI progress can be\nslowed at around the time that recursive improvement becomes possible.\nIABIED presumably says no. I expect AIs of that time will provide\nvaluable advice. Maybe that advice will just be about how to shut down\nAI development. But more likely it will convince us to adopt a good\nparadigm that has been lingering in neglect.\nIn sum, IABIED dismisses superalignment much too quickly.\nHeading to ASI?\nI have some disagreement with IABIED's claim about how quickly an ASI\ncould defeat humans. But that has little effect on how scared we ought\nto be. The main uncertainty about whether an ASI could defeat humans is\nabout what kind of AI would be defending humans.\nOur concern is for what comes after: machine intelligence that is\ngenuinely smart, smarter than any living human, smarter than humanity\ncollectively.\nThey define superintelligence (ASI) as an AI that is \"a mind much more\ncapable than any human at almost every sort of steering and prediction\nproblem\". They seem to write as if \"humanity collectively\" and \"any\nhuman\" were interchangeable. I want to keep those concepts distinct.\nIf they just meant smarter than the collective humanity of 2025, then I\nagree that they have strong reason to think we're on track to get there\nin the 2030s. Prediction markets are forecasting a 50% chance of the\nweaker meaning of ASI before\n2035. I\nfind it easy to imagine that collective humanity of 2025 is sufficiently\nweak that an ASI would eclipse it a few years after reaching that weak\nmeaning of ASI.\nBut IABIED presumably wants to predict an ASI that is smarter than the\ncollective humanity at the time the ASI is created. I predict that\nhumanity then will be significantly harder to defeat than the collective\nhumanity of 2025, due to defenses built with smarter-than-a-single-human\nAI.\nSo I don't share IABIED's confidence that we're on track to get\nworld-conquering AI. I expect it to be a close call as to whether\ndefenses improve fast enough.\nIABIED denies that their arguments depend on fast takeoff, but I see\ntakeoff speed as having a large influence on how plausible their\narguments are. An ASI that achieves god-like powers within days of\nreaching human-level intelligence would almost certainly be able to\nconquer humanity. If AI takes a decade to go from human level to clearly\nbut not dramatically smarter than any human at every task, then it looks\nunlikely that that ASI will be able to conquer humanity.\nI expect takeoff to be fast enough that IABIED's perspective here\nwon't end up looking foolish, but will look overconfident.\nI expect the likelihood of useful fire alarms to depend strongly on\ntakeoff speed. I see a better than 50% chance that a fire alarm will\nsignificantly alter AI policy. Whereas if I believed in MIRI's version\nof foom, I'd put that at more like 5%.\nShard Theory vs Utility Functions\nThe MIRI paradigm models values as being produced by a utility function,\nwhereas some other researchers prefer shard theory. IABIED avoids\ndrawing attention to this, but it still has subtle widespread influences\non their reasoning.\nNeither of these models are wrong. Each one is useful for a different\nset of purposes. They nudge us toward different guesses about what\nvalues AIs will have.\nThe utility function model of searching through the space of possible\nutility functions increases the salience of alien minds.\nWhereas shard theory comes closer to modeling the process that generated\nhuman minds and which generates the values of existing AIs.\nNote that there are strong arguments that AIs will want to adopt value\nsystems that qualify as utility functions as they approach god-like\nlevels of rationality. I don't see that being very relevant to what I\nsee as the period of acute risk, when I expect the AIs to have\nshard-like values that aren't coherent enough to be usefully analyzed\nas utility functions. Coherence might be\nhard.\nIABIED wants us to be certain that a small degree of misalignment will\nbe fatal. As Will MacAskill put\nit:\nI think Y&S often equivocate between two different concepts under the\nidea of \"misalignment\":\nImperfect alignment: The AI doesn't always try to do what the\ndeveloper/user intended it to try to do. 2. Catastrophic misalignment:\nThe AI tries hard to disempower all humanity, insofar as it has the\nopportunity.\nMax Harms explains a reason for\nuncertainty\nthat makes sense within the MIRI paradigm (see the Types of\nmisalignment section).\nI see a broader uncertainty. Many approaches to AI, including current\nAIs, create conflicting goals. If such an AI becomes superhuman, it\nseems likely to resolve those conflicts in ways that depend on many\ndetails of how the AI works. Some of those resolution methods are likely\nto work well. We should maybe pay more attention to whether we can\ninfluence which methods an AI ends up using.\nAsimov's Three Laws illustrate a mistake that makes imperfect alignment\nmore catastrophic than it needs to be. He provided a clear rule for\nresolving conflicts. Why did he explicitly give corrigibility a lower\npriority than the First Law?\nMy guess is that imperfect alignment of current AIs would end up working\nlike a rough approximation of the moral\nparliament.\nI'm guessing, with very low confidence, that that means humans get a\nslice of the lightcone.\nAIs Won't Keep Their Promises\nFrom AIs won't keep their\npromises:\nNatural selection has difficulty finding the genes that cause a human\nto keep deals only in the cases where our long-term reputation is a\nmajor consideration. It was easier to just evolve an instinctive\ndistaste for lying and cheating.\nAll of the weird fiddly cases where humans sometimes keep a promise\neven when it's not actually beneficial to us are mainly evidence about\nwhat sorts of emotions were most helpful in our tribal ancestral\nenvironment while also being easy for evolution to encode into\ngenomes, rather than evidence about some universally useful cognitive\nstep.\nThis section convinced me that I'd been thoughtlessly overconfident\nabout making deals with AIs. I've now switched to being mildly\npessimistic about them keeping deals.\nYet the details of IABIED's reasoning seem weird. I'm pretty sure that\nhuman honor is mostly a cultural phenomenon, combined with a modest\namount of intelligent awareness of the value of reputation.\nCultural influences are more likely to be transmitted to AI values via\ntraining data than are genetic influences.\nBut any such honor is likely to be at least mildly context dependent,\nand the relevant context is novel enough to create much uncertainty.\nMore importantly, honor depends on incentives in complex ways. Once\nagain, IABIED's conclusions seem pretty likely given foom (which\nprobably gives one AI a decisive advantage). Those conclusions seem\nrather unlikely in a highly multipolar scenario resulting from a fairly\nslow takeoff, where the AI needs to trade with a diverse set of other\nAIs. (This isn't a complete description of the controversial\nassumptions that are needed in order to analyze this).\nI predict fast enough takeoff that I'm worried that IABIED is correct\nhere. But I have trouble respecting claims of more than 80% confidence\nhere. IABIED sounds more than 80% confident.\nConclusion\nSee also my Comments on MIRI's The\nProblem\nfor more thoughts about MIRI's overconfidence. IABIED's treatment of\ncorrigibility\nconfirms my pessimism about their ability to recognize progress toward\nsafety.\nI agree that if humans, with no further enhancement, build ASI, the\nrisks are unacceptably high. But we probably are on track for something\nmodestly different from that: ASI built by humans who have been\nsubstantially enhanced by AIs that are almost superhuman.\nI see AI companies as being reckless enough that we ought to be unsure\nof their sanity. Whereas if I fully agreed with IABIED, I'd say\nthey're insane enough that an ideal world would shut down and disband\nthose companies completely.\nThis post has probably sounded too confident. I'm pretty confident that\nI'm pointing in the general direction of important flaws in IABIED's\narguments. But I doubt that I've done an adequate job of clarifying\nthose flaws. I'm unsure how much of my disagreement is due to\ncommunication errors, and how much is due to substantive confusion\nsomewhere.\nIABIED is likely correct that following their paradigm would require\ndecades of research in order to produce much progress. I'm mildly\npessimistic that a shutdown which starts soon could be enforced for\ndecades. IABIED didn't do much to explain why the MIRI paradigm is good\nenough that we should be satisfied with it.\nThose are some of the reasons why I consider it important to look for\nother paradigms. Alas, I only have bits and pieces of a good paradigm in\nmind.\nIt feels like any paradigm needs to make some sort of bet on the speed\nof takeoff. Slow takeoff implies a rather different set of risks than\ndoes foom. It doesn't look like we can find a paradigm that's fully\nappropriate for all takeoff speeds. That's an important part of why\nit's hard to find the right paradigm. Getting this right is hard, in\npart because takeoff speed can be influenced by whether there's a race,\nand by whether AIs recommend slowing down at key points.\nI expect that a good paradigm would induce more researchers to focus on\ncorrigibility, whereas the current paradigms seem to cause neglect via\neither implying that corrigibility is too easy to require much thought,\nor too hard for an unenhanced human to tackle.\nI'm 60% confident that the path to safety involves a focus on\ncorrigibility. Thinking clearly about corrigibility seems at most\nPearl-level hard. It likely still involves lots of stumbling about to\nask the right questions and recognize good answers when we see them.\nI'm disappointed that IABIED doesn't advocate efforts to separate AIs\ngoals from their world models, in order to make it easier to influence\nthose goals. Yann LeCun has cost module that is separate from the AI's\nworld\nmodel. It\nwould be ironic if LeCun ended up helping more than the AI leaders who\nsay they're worried about safety.\nI approve of IABIED's attempt to write for a broader audience than one\nthat would accept the MIRI paradigm. It made the book a bit more\neffective at raising awareness of AI risks. But it left a good deal of\nconfusion that an ideal book would have resolved.\nP.S. - My AI-related investments did quite well in September, with the\nresult that my AI-heavy portfolio was up almost 20%. I'm unsure how\nmuch of that is connected to the book - it's not like there was a\nsudden surprise on the day the book was published. But my intuition says\nthere was some sort of connection.\nEliezer continues to be more effective at persuading people that AI will\nbe powerful, than at increasing people's p(doom). But p(powerful) is\nmore important to update than p(doom), as long as your p(doom) doesn't\nround to zero.\nOr maybe he did an excellent job of timing the book's publication for\nwhen the world was ready to awaken to AI's power.\nDiscuss",

      "title": "AI System Boosts Accuracy of National Flood Predictions, Study Finds",
      "url": "https://www.aiwire.net/2025/10/08/ai-system-boosts-accuracy-of-national-flood-predictions-study-finds/",
      "summary": "A new artificial intelligence tool could make flood forecasts more accurate and actionable, according to a study published in AGU Advances. Researchers found that combining a machine learning model with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Water Model significantly improved the accuracy of national-scale flood predictions. The system, called Errorcastnet, was developed by a team led by scientist Vinh Ngoc Tran at the University of Michigan. Based on a neural network, Errorcastnet acts as a correction layer for NOAA’s process-based model, identifying and learning from systematic errors in past forecasts. When integrated with the National Water Model, the hybrid approach boosted accuracy by a factor of four to six across lead times of one to ten days, the researchers reported. The findings show how, rather than replacing physics-based systems with AI, scientists are now exploring ways to combine the strengths of both. Pairing Physics With Machine Learning NOAA’s National Water Model simulates and forecasts conditions for rivers and streams across the contiguous United States, providing updates multiple times per day. The model draws data from nearly 11,000 operational water gauges that measure rainfall, runoff, and river flow. The model also factors in vegetation, urban development, and drainage patterns for more hydrologic accuracy. Forecasting errors occur when these complex interactions are incompletely modeled or when local data gaps exist. Lead researcher Tran and his colleagues trained their neural network on years of NOAA data, including rainfall and flooding records, to help identify where and why those mismatches occurred. “So especially for floods, the performance of the pure AI model is quite poor,” said Tran in an AGU release. “The advantage of the AI models is that they are very simple. You only need to use the data to train the model and provide the forecast, but the most important thing we need to be concerned about is ensuring prediction accuracy for flood events that can cause significant damage.” Errorcastnet’s role is to analyze the historical performance of the National Water Model, determine which types of errors can be corrected, and refine the outputs accordingly. Some errors, such as those linked to physical limitations or missing data, cannot be fixed but can add to the system’s ongoing training. “You can’t throw away physics,” said Valeriy Ivanov, physical hydrologist at the University of Michigan and an author of the study. “It’s just by definition you can’t. You have to understand that systems are different. The landscapes are different. You have to account for dominant physical processes in your predictive model.” With that philosophy in mind, the researchers turned to machine learning to see how far it could push existing models without discarding the underlying physics. The system uses an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle long sequences of input data such as weather time series. The “attention” mechanism helps the model focus on the most relevant patterns in those sequences, improving its ability to identify when and where past forecasts went wrong. To account for uncertainty, the researchers used a technique called Monte Carlo dropout, which runs the network thousands of times with small random variations. The resulting ensemble of predictions provides not just a single streamflow estimate, but a range of possible outcomes and their probabilities known as an ensemble forecast. Model performance was evaluated using established hydrologic metrics, including the Kling-Gupta Efficiency, which measures overall forecast skill, as well as peak error and time-to-peak error, which capture how well the model predicts the height and timing of flood events. The result is a hybrid framework that leverages AI to correct known biases in the model while preserving the physical realism essential to hydrologic forecasting, which could act as a blueprint for how AI can enhance established scientific modeling systems. Toward Faster, More Reliable Flood Warnings According to the study, Errorcastnet can generate ensemble flood forecasts at a national scale in minutes using its computationally efficient framework. The researchers believe this approach could eventually enable detailed flood predictions several days before an event, while enhancing the reliability of early warning systems worldwide, particularly in areas where flood monitoring infrastructure is limited. While the current system is trained on NOAA data from the U.S., it can be adapted for other regions using local hydrological information, the authors say. The study, titled “AI Improves the Accuracy, Reliability, and Economic Value of Continental-Scale Flood Predictions,” appears in AGU Advances. Co-authors include scientists from the University of Michigan, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Virginia, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Ulsan in South Korea.",

      "title": "Bloomberg Finds AI Data Centers Fueling America’s Energy Bill Crisis",
      "url": "https://www.aiwire.net/2025/10/08/bloomberg-finds-ai-data-centers-fueling-americas-energy-bill-crisis/",
      "summary": "The rise of AI is putting real pressure on the U.S. power grid. As demand for compute explodes, the data centers behind AI systems are becoming some of the country’s top energy users. They are essential to digital life now, but their nonstop energy use is starting to reshape how electricity is priced and distributed across the nation. A Bloomberg investigation found that wholesale electricity prices have spiked dramatically in areas near major data centers. In one example, prices for a single month were 267% higher than five years ago. Among the sites with the largest increases, about 75% were located within 50 miles of a dense cluster of data centers. The impact spreads through regional grids, meaning even households and businesses far from these facilities are paying more. Behind every AI application is a constant stream of data. These centers do not just process information—they absorb, store, and move enormous volumes around the clock. GPUs run intensive training and inference jobs nonstop, while petabyte-scale storage holds model datasets. This activity produces serious heat, and the cooling systems needed to manage it drive energy use even higher. The model is always-on and built for growth, which turns each facility into a permanent power drain on the grid. Bloomberg’s analysis points to a massive shift. By 2035, data centers supporting AI could use close to 9% of all U.S. electricity. That number would have sounded absurd a few years ago. But it is not just about how many machines are online. What matters is the movement of data, the need for speed, and the enormous infrastructure behind it. That burden, combined with aging grid systems, is sending prices upward, even in places where no AI center exists. Much of the recent growth is centered in places like Iowa, Georgia, and parts of the Southwest. These regions offer cheaper land, fewer permitting barriers, and relatively easier access to power. However, many of them were never designed for this kind of industrial electricity use. Even areas with no facilities are now feeling the strain, as power from neighboring grids gets diverted to meet the load. According to Mark Christie, a former chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put it plainly, “The reliability crisis is here now; it’s not off in the distance somewhere.” He is referring to the blackouts and grid instability that could happen when energy demand rises faster than utilities can build the infrastructure to support it. In many cases, utilities are being flooded with interconnection requests from new data centers, driving up projected loads at a pace that outstrips planning cycles. This pressure is not unique to the U.S. In Japan, electricity auction prices have climbed to record highs as the government prepares for a boom in AI workloads. Malaysia recently raised data center electricity rates because of local shortages. In the U.K., Aurora Energy Research estimates that power demand from AI infrastructure could drive a 9% increase in electricity prices by 2040. Worldwide, data centers may use over 4% of all electricity by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. If these facilities were a country, they would rank fourth in energy consumption—just behind China, the U.S., and India. In the U.S. alone, AI-related data center power use is expected to grow from about 4.5% now to nearly 9% by 2035. Some experts are calling this the biggest jump in power demand since the arrival of air conditioning in the 1960s. David Crane, CEO of Generate Capital and former Biden energy adviser, said: “Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans.” He warned that some U.S. regions could face brownouts as early as next year if demand keeps rising without a coordinated grid response. Meanwhile, politics is shaping how the country responds. Some leaders have promised to cut electricity prices by 50%, but household bills have only gone up. Federal policies have recently pulled back support for wind, solar, and storage. BloombergNEF now expects the yearly rollout of clean energy projects by 2035 to be 23% lower than it would have been under earlier targets. At the same time, new investment is being funneled into coal, gas, and nuclear sources, complicating the path forward. With AI infrastructure growing fast and the grid already under stress, the cost of data is no longer just measured in dollars. It is being measured in kilowatts, too.

      "url": "https://www.aiwire.net/2025/10/08/ais-big-data-step-function/",
      "summary": "Conventional wisdom holds that you need to fix your data management shortcomings before succeeding with AI. But that may no longer be true, according to some tech execs, who see the potential to apply generative AI’s capability to grasp language and fix data management issues at the same time you’re building AI apps. Rahul Pathak, the vice president of data and AI go to market at AWS, considers himself an old school data guy, the kind who would never recommend taking shortcuts in order to show success on paper. So when he suggests that GenAI might allow you jump ahead in your data management capabilities and get results faster, you might want to take notice. “We were in a world where you would have to serialize your way through this, where you would have to get the data house in order, then you would have to build the app that sits on top of the data,” Pathak says. “I think you can actually change this process a little bit, where you can start to unlock your data for AI almost immediately, using well-governed, secure MCP endpoints and state of the art models. [They] can really help you unlock that data almost in place that can then start to help you light up the AI applications.” Not all AI use cases are the same, obviously. Some use cases may require data to be collected, cleansed, and prepared before it touches an AI algorithm. But when it comes to running inference workloads on pre-trained models, staging the data may not be a possibility, in which case a federated approach would be in order. The good news is that Model Context Protocol (MCP) covers up a lot of data sins that may previously have required a considerable amount of atonement (not to mention data management pain and dollars). “I’m somewhat of an old school data person at this point, but you can think of the MCP server as almost like a federated query,” Pathak said. “The model lets you get the data. It’s somewhat schema resilient. And then the knowledge base and the index is almost like a materialized view. And so in that combination, you can get the data much faster. And the intelligence in the models does augment the capabilities of the data engineer and data scientist in a way that really allows them to move much faster than we could before.” Pathak had a real-world example in the form of a manufacturing company that wanted to use generative AI to speed up production. The company had reams of telemetry data already collected, but it was proving to be difficult and time-consuming to extract the knowledge out of that telemetry data to apply it to the factory line. The solution was to use the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of GenAI to extract the pertinent pieces of data out of the telemetry data. Those insights were then fed into traditional machine learning optimization models. On the back end, GenAI was used again to generate the instructions that told the operators how to modify their process to speed up production. “It’s that kind of integration that allows us to move much faster than we could before,” Pathak said. “Because otherwise you’d have a big data and ETL and kind of data munging project that you’d have to do to get that telemetry off and usable quickly. And we can do that much, much faster now. So that’s a big unlock.” Another proponent of skipping the big data management project and jumping straight into GenAI projects is PromptQL. The company developed a GenAI-based query tool that allows users to begin querying their data immediately, without going through the time-consuming process of building a semantic layer. A semantic layer is still important, the folks at PromptQL say, because it serves to translate a business’ specific terms and metrics into the technical table names that the tool needs to serve accurate queries. But the big difference is that PromptQL advocates building the semantic layer as you go, and customizing it over time thanks to feedback from users. Spending months or years on a big-bang data management project is a path to endless POCs and ultimately failure, they say. The high failure rate of early AI projects is the elephant in the room. The recent MIT study that found 95% of GenAI projects never get out of the trial stage has people on edge. With trillions of dollars being invested in acquiring speedy GPUs, massive storage arrays, and huge AI data centers, some very wealthy institutions are placing some big bets on AI. Smaller companies with fewer resources have to be much smarter about how they attack the AI opportunity. The good news is that GenAI’s capability to grasp language can be employed in a multitude of ways, including using it to understand how data is modeled, which can potentially allow you to, if not skip the data management stage, at least tackle it at the same time that you’re building your first AI project. “These aren’t sequential steps anymore,” Pathak says. “I think that’s a big paradigm shift for a lot of companies that are dealing with legacy data challenges, which, frankly, we’ve been dealing with since we had more than one table in the database.” “I think what generative AI has done and what’s different now,” he says, “is that it’s really given us some superpowers Read more…",

      "url": "https://www.aiwire.net/2025/10/08/is-ai-finally-ready-to-make-a-discovery-worthy-of-the-nobel-prize/",
      "summary": "In laboratories across the world, AI tools have been aiding researchers in sorting through data, simulating reactions, and even generating what look like plausible hypotheses. First, they were assistants, then collaborators; now the lines are increasingly blurry. The machines are learning to ask their own questions, and in certain cases, design their own experiments to answer them. A recent Nature article brings this tension back into focus, laying out a bold question: could an AI ever win a Nobel Prize? Have we finally reached the phase where this prestigious award goes to a machine or software? Well, it no longer seems as implausible as it might have a few years ago. From forecasting chemical reactions to revealing biological pathways, AI models are moving closer toward autonomous discovery. Some researchers say it’s only a matter of time until a machine churns out Nobel-worthy work. The only thing less clear is whether we are ready to give it a Nobel Prize for its work. One of the most prominent initiatives tied to this question is the Nobel Turing Challenge. Launched in 2016 by Hiroaki Kitano, CEO of Sony AI, it sets an ambitious goal for the future of AI in science. It poses the same question we are asking now: Can we build an AI that could be awarded a Nobel Prize for a discovery of its own? Not as a helper, not even as a co-author, but as the primary architect behind the entire scientific process. To be successful, such a system would have to identify its own research question, design and conduct its own experiments, make sense of the results, and discover something genuinely new. It would need to be a fully independent discovery, based on new ideas or pathways that even human researchers hadn’t anticipated or understood. So far, that hasn’t happened. However, according to some the moment is nearer than we know. “Human-level painting is a challenge,” says Ross King, an AI researcher at the University of Cambridge and one of the competition’s organizers. He believes the same is true for scientific breakthroughs. It could take decades, or it might arrive much sooner. AI’s progress has been impressive. While no AI has yet made a Nobel-winning discovery by itself, the early shape of that idea is already visible in today’s research labs. In 2024, the chemistry Nobel Prize honoured the creators of AlphaFold, a system that made extremely accurate predictions about roughly how proteins would fold into three dimensions. The humans behind the project got the prize, but it was AI that made the breakthrough. That moment marked a shift. It demonstrated that machines could do more than help out. They might answer questions that had stumped scientists for decades. Other cases are catching up fast. At Carnegie Mellon, researchers developed the Coscientist system that applies LLMs to plan and execute complex chemical reactions with robotic lab gear. At Stanford, AI models are finding biological patterns in RNA data that have eluded even the most experienced researchers. In startups such as FutureHouse, teams are building a modular system of AI agents, each tuned for specific scientific tasks, like structuring experimental data, planning studies, or finding relevant papers. They are training AI systems to ask their own scientific questions, and experimenting on what an AI can do on its own without having a human guide them. Sure, these might be just baby steps, but they suggest something bigger. AI is no longer just accelerating discovery. It’s beginning to think for itself, and in some very real ways, that might already be enough to fundamentally alter both how discoveries are made and who makes them. Still, even with all this progress, a truly independent “AI scientist” remains out of reach. Researchers at the Allen Institute for AI recently tested dozens of systems and found that while most could finish small, clearly defined tasks, almost none could carry out a full study from start to finish. They could predict patterns, simulate reactions, and even write reports, but when asked to design and reason through an entire discovery, success rates drop dramatically. In other words, AI can imitate the outcomes of science far more easily than it can create something truly original. That gap may come down to something no machine has yet achieved: human experience. As Arizona State University’s Subbarao Kambhampati has pointed out, AI learns only through data. Human scientists live in the world they study, guided by curiosity, intuition, and sometimes even failure. “I’m very supportive of claims that AI can accelerate science,” Kambhampati says. “But to say that you don’t need human scientists and that this machine will just make some Nobel-worthy discovery sounds like nothing more than hype.” Yolanda Gil at the University of Southern California (an AIwire Person to Watch) has spent years thinking about what kind of intelligence would be needed for an AI to truly reason the way scientists do. She believes the key lies in teaching systems to reflect on their own thinking, not just process more data. Still, she admits that work in that direction has faded into the background as LLMs have stolen the spotlight. “There are so many exciting results that you can get with generative AI techniques,” she told Nature, “but there’s a lot of other areas to pay attention to.” There is no denying that AI is getting better at scientific research and development. But even if an AI did pull off a discovery worthy of the prize, Read more…",

      "title": "AMD and OpenAI Unveil Massive Chip Deal for AI Inference",
      "url": "https://www.aiwire.net/2025/10/08/amd-and-openai-unveil-massive-chip-deal-for-ai-inference/",
      "summary": "Another week, another massive investment in chips by an AI firm. This week’s edition features OpenAI committing to buying billions of dollars worth of AI accelerators from AMD, one of the semiconductor companies aiming to knock Nvidia off its GPU pedestal. The deal unveiled Monday calls for OpenAI to buy up to 6 gigawatts worth of AMD AI accelerators over the next five years, with the first gigawatt consisting of AMD’s next-generation Instinct GPU, the MI450, delivered in the second half of 2026. In exchange for the chips, OpenAI will get a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock. That represents roughly 10% of AMD’s outstanding shares. The company’s stock opened up 33% on the news. OpenAI requires massive numbers of processors to train its large language models (LLMs) and to run them for inference, but has struggled to obtain enough. Nvidia remains the preferred supplier for large-scale AI training with its Blackwell line of GPUs and Grace Blackwell superchips, but it’s been unable to meet insatiable market demand. OpenAI has sourced AI accelerators where it can get them. It uses AMD MI300X and MI350X series chips, and it recently entered into contract with XPU-maker Broadcom to design its own custom AI accelerators in a deal that is reportedly worth $10 billion. The deal with AMD, which CEO Lisa Su said Sunday could generate tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD by 2030, demonstrates that the market is receptive to names other than Nvidia when it comes to AI training and inference. In fact, AMD’s MI450 stacks up fairly nicely against Nvidia’s best. The MI450 is expected to feature up to 432GB worth of HBM4 memory and deliver upwards of 40 PFLOPs of FP4 capacity when it ships in 2H26. That compares favorably with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will feature 288GB of HBM4 per GPU and deliver 50 PFLOPS of dense FP4 compute capacity when it ships next year. Nvidia has benefited enormously from its dominant position in AI accelerators. Its revenues have increased by nearly 7x over the past four years, to $130.5 billion for fiscal 2025, and it has become the most valuable company in the world with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Nvidia has searched for ways to invest its capital, and not surprisingly, it involves investing in AI companies so they can buy more of its chips. Two weeks ago, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in a deal that involves OpenAI eventually buying 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia’s chips, starting with the delivery of next-gen Vera Rubin GPUs in the second half of 2026. The AI boom has kicked off a massive spending spree to build new AI data centers. Cloud giants like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are spending trillions of dollars to build hundreds of new data centers around the country and outfit them with systems, processors, storage, and network. The focus in AI has shifted from model training to inference workloads. OpenAI, in particular, is looking to offer inference services to customers as a way to turn a profit. Last year, CEO Sam Altman told investors it was on pace to lose $44 billion until 2029, when it finally expects to bring in more than it spends.

      "summary": "Square, the point-of-sale system owned by Jack Dorsey’s Block, is announcing a number of new upgrades today—including one that will make it easier for business owners to accept payments in Bitcoin.\nOn Wednesday, the company made three announcements: \nAn expansion of its platform for restaurants (including AI-voice ordering and a bigger, broader Grubhub integration)\nA conversational AI assistant embedded in its dashboard to answer questions, called Square AI\nSquare Bitcoin: An integrated Bitcoin payment and wallet system for business owners\nThe upgrades and announcements are designed to help business owners control their costs, dig up more insights within their data, and plan ahead with more confidence, Willem Avé, Square’s head of product, tells Fast Company. \n“We’re focused on anything we can do to help small businesses compete better,” Avé says. \nThat includes a smattering of new and beefed-up features for restaurant operators, specifically, such as AI voiced ordering, which allows customers to call in and place an order with an AI assistant (while also answering questions about the menu and make customizations). \nMeanwhile, a speedier kiosk will help orders get entered faster, and enhanced accounting and sales reports—plus an Order Guide—will help restaurateurs get a clearer picture of their costs and revenue.\nAvé says that the voice-ordering feature is particularly interesting, as the technology has only recently become good enough to launch. At the beginning of this past summer, for example, it wouldn’t have worked, he says.\n“We believe that the tech is finally here to build a natural, good, AI-based ordering system,” Avé adds.\n‘The tech is there, the demand is there’\nPerhaps the most interesting announcement of the day is the launch of Square Bitcoin, which allows businesses to accept Bitcoin payments, automatically store those payments in a designated wallet, convert other revenue to Bitcoin, and do it all with no processing fees through the end of next year. \n“Square has always been about accepting any type of payment that comes across the counter,” Avé says, and so giving businesses the power to integrate with crypto in a relatively simple way was a natural step for the company. \n“The tech is there, and the demand is there, and from a cost perspective, Bitcoin payments are cheaper” for businesses, he says. \nWhile some large merchant chains accept cryptocurrency payments—a list that includes the Home Depot, Chipotle, and Whole Foods—it’s been, thus far, a difficult implementation for small companies.\nSquare’s announcement could change that, all while crypto adoption and prices reach a fever pitch. The timing isn’t necessarily a coincidence, as Avé says the company has been trying to move quicker as customer needs evolve.\n“This release is highlighting that speed is the name of the game,” he says, “and we’re moving faster than ever.”",

      "title": "Why the world’s top talent should bet on Stockholm",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91419107/why-the-worlds-top-talent-should-bet-on-stockholm",
      "summary": "The world’s best engineers, entrepreneurs, and researchers face no shortage of opportunities. If you’re building the future in frontier technologies like AI, you could base yourself anywhere. So the real question is where. The answer today points north—to Stockholm.\nThe European Commission recently declared Stockholm as Europe’s most innovative region. Ahead of Copenhagen, London, and Zurich, the Swedish capital took the top spot. Not just overall, but on a range of individual indicators, from lifelong learning and share of tech specialists employed to cross-border scientific publications, collaboration between SMEs, patent filings, and trademarks.\nRight after the European Commission’s report, the city’s own Lovable was declared the fastest-growing software startup in global history. This is another indicator of Stockholm as Europe’s capital of the future—admittedly anecdotal, yet hard to ignore.\nSTOCKHOLM’S LIFESTYLE EDGE\nOf course, for you—a global top talent—there are regions beyond Europe to consider. The U.S. and China still have metro areas that are more innovative, for now. But what Europe’s innovative center can also offer is another way of life.\nSweden consistently ranks among the world’s most gender-equal societies. The childcare system is outstanding—enabling both parents to combine engaged parenthood with career advancement. Society is cultural, creative, democratic, egalitarian, and open. Clean air and water, smooth public transportation, and buildings designed for light and ventilation make daily life in Stockholm unusually comfortable.\nGovernment bureaucracy is light for individuals and companies. Starting a business is easy, energy prices are among Europe’s lowest, and taxes not as high as Sweden’s reputation suggests. With no wealth or inheritance tax, low corporate tax rate, and minimal everyday costs for healthcare, childcare, and education, the benefits often exceed the income tax rate headlines.\nAdd in generous parental leave (exported by Spotify to the U.S.) and EU freedom of movement, and this capital offers a package of benefits rarely matched in other hubs. For many specialists, flatter structures and shorter weeks tip the balance in Stockholm’s favor.\nFast Company recognized our Stockholm-based real estate firm as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies. My job at Atrium Ljungberg can perhaps best be described as playing SimCity but in real life, with the city I love most as the game board.\nTo be fully transparent, the job comes with a dose of stakeholder management and administration that SimCity leaves out—but still, the analogy is strikingly true.\nStockholm is evolving, and it’s a thrill to be part of the ride: Atrium Ljungberg is redeveloping Slakthusområdet, the world’s largest transformation of a meatpacking district, while also building Stockholm Wood City. The renewal of Slussen, a central hub, is nearing completion, as is the expansion of Hagastaden, linking the city with Europe’s top medical university and hospital. They knit old districts and new innovation hubs into a more connected city.\nFROM NOBEL PRIZES TO SPOTIFY: THE CITY’S LONG GAME\nHow did Stockholm become Europe’s most innovative region? It helps to start at the beginning. Stockholm’s tradition has long shown progress.\nBy the 1880s, Stockholm had the most telephones of any city in the world. The Nobel Prize was established in 1901 and soon became the world’s most prestigious award across five scientific disciplines, later joined by a sixth in economics.\nA series of world-class companies were created here in the pre-WW2 industrial era, including Ericsson, Atlas Copco, and Electrolux. That period laid the groundwork for Stockholm’s rise.\nThe city gained a reputation as a hub of practical innovation and engineering. In 1954, the Royal Institute of Technology hosted Sweden’s first nuclear reactor, built underground in the middle of the city. By the 1980s, Stockholm’s universities were among Europe’s first online.\nThe 1997 “Home PC reform” gave Swedes tax-free access to computers via employers, driving mass adoption and digital skills.\nSince the 90s, Stockholm has produced another wave of champions: Spotify, the leading music streaming service globally; EQT, one of the world’s largest private equity firms; and Klarna, a fintech giant. Stockholm now counts more listed firms than any European city, including London and Frankfurt.\nAlong the way, Stockholm also became a creative capital. The city that once exported timber and steel now exports pop music, design and gaming—from Avicii to Acne and Minecraft, with billions playing our video games.\nIn 1968, only a quarter of Swedes had eaten out in the last quarter, and kitchens still shut at 8 p.m. Today, Stockholm is a city full of Michelin stars, neighborhood bistros, late-night bars, and clubs.\nTHE ECOSYSTEM BUILDING EUROPE’S NEXT GIANTS\nSweden ranks first in Europe by VC investment per capita and unicorn creation per capita. But capital alone doesn’t build companies—talent does. In Stockholm today, workplaces are increasingly designed to attract it: more like clubs or labs than offices, they give talent autonomy, wellbeing, and connection.\nA diverse set of Stockholm ventures is now breaking ground. Einride, putting autonomous electric trucks on roads across continents, and Candela, whose electric boats ferry Stockholm’s commuters, drive the future of transportation. Fashion and beauty names Toteme and Estrid stand beside music investor Pophouse, steward of catalogues from Avicii to KISS and Cyndi Lauper. Investors Creandum, EQT Ventures, Northzone, and Norrsken have underpinned the city’s ascent as one of Europe’s leading venture hubs.\nScaling companies consume vast amounts of energy. To support the soaring demand, national energy company Vattenfall and the government just announced that Sweden will build a series of small modular reactors (SMRs). The initiative is notable globally: While most countries are still piloting single SMR projects, Sweden is planning a program at scale, aimed directly at powering fast-growing industries.\nPropelled by clean energy, culture, and investment, few places combine beauty and dynamism like Stockholm: the Nordic Venice with its islands, a cultural city from Gustav III’s opera house, to Max Martin’s pop, built on democracy and openness. Yet its real strength lies in its trajectory. For builders, creatives, and intellectuals, Stockholm has become Europe’s most attractive base to change the world from.\nLinus Kjellberg is head of business development at Atrium Ljungberg.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91419096/tackle-the-hidden-barriers-that-sideline-girls",
      "summary": "When I worked in tech, I often heard engineering leaders explain why they couldn’t hire more women or minorities: the so-called pipeline problem. They claimed there simply weren’t enough qualified candidates entering the system, so naturally the pool of diverse talent remained thin. Many of us in the ecosystem called BS. The reality wasn’t a lack of qualified people; it was a lack of imagination, access, and commitment to creating inclusive environments where diverse talent could thrive.\nFast forward to my work today in women’s sports. I find myself thinking about that same phrase—this time with a twist. In sports, a pipeline problem is very real, and very serious. Girls drop out of sports at far higher rates than boys, often by age 14. Not because they lack talent or ambition, but because hidden, solvable barriers stand in their way. Research points to a variety of reasons: lack of access to facilities, fewer female coaches, cultural pressures, and economic hurdles. But there are also subtler obstacles—menstrual stigma, inadequate athletic gear, transportation gaps, or not feeling seen and supported in spaces where they’re underrepresented. These aren’t headline-grabbing issues, but they can determine whether a girl keeps playing or quietly walks away.\nThis isn’t just about missed opportunities on the field. Sports participation is directly tied to confidence, leadership skills, academic performance, and future career success. When we lose girls from the pipeline, we lose future team captains, CEOs, scientists, and community leaders.\nTHE HIDDEN BARRIERS\nWith gender equity in sports, the conversation often centers on the field of play—media coverage, equal pay, prize money, sponsorship. These are important, visible markers of progress. Yet, what often goes unnoticed are the less visible, deeply practical barriers that prevent girls from staying in the game in the first place.\nThis year’s Gainbridge Assists Powered by Parity grants, in partnership with the Women’s Sports Foundation, expanded to empower changemakers addressing these obstacles. Thirty-two recipients across 20 states will receive $222,000 (total), funding projects ensuring girls can fully participate in sport—and benefit from the resulting lifelong confidence, leadership, and health outcomes.\nIn addition to funding camps, clinics, and playing opportunities in sports from basketball and soccer to fencing, lacrosse, and wrestling, this year’s grantees are tackling some of the obstacles head on. These efforts recognize that access alone isn’t enough if hidden barriers continue holding girls back:\nMenstrual health. For many student-athletes, lack of menstrual products access is a silent barrier sidelining them from school and sport. In 2025, no girl should have to sit out practice because she can’t afford pads or tampons, or because she’s embarrassed to ask for them. Period Project Indianapolis is breaking that silence, distributing free menstrual products and normalizing reproductive health conversations in locker rooms and communities.\n\n\n\n\nProper gear. For adolescent girls, a well-fitting sports bra can determine whether they stay engaged in sport. Athletes for Hope, partnering with Bras for Girls, provides gear and the education girls need while navigating puberty. Without this kind of intervention, physical discomfort and body image anxieties drive too many girls to drop out during adolescence.\n\n\n\n\nMental health support. Sports can be a powerful tool for wellbeing, but only when participation feels safe and inclusive. The pressures young athletes face—balancing academics and expectations—can weigh heavily. When stress or anxiety go unaddressed, sports can feel like another impossible demand. The initiative supports programs integrating mental health resources into athletics. The Skills Center in Tampa will use its funding to host a girls sports and empowerment festival, combining physical activity with mental health workshops for Black and Latina youth. Meanwhile, ZGiRLS will deliver sport psychology programming to help girls manage stress, anxiety, and family pressures during the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\nTransportation. For many girls, the challenge isn’t desire but logistics. Getting to practice is a barrier. Families without reliable transportation or parents working multiple jobs can’t always shuttle daughters across town. It’s a small obstacle with outsized consequences—often ending in quiet resignation. Fisk University, home to the first HBCU women’s gymnastics team, is working to overcome this hurdle.\nEach factor might sound small in isolation, but together, they form a web of barriers pushing girls out of sports before they can realize their potential.\nINNOVATION BEYOND THE GAME\nIn business, we talk endlessly about innovation. We laud breakthrough technologies and new markets. But what if innovation also meant tackling the overlooked barriers that keep people from participating in the first place?\nThat’s what these grantees are doing: rethinking how to support the game and the players. True innovation in women’s sports identifies overlooked pain points and designs solutions rooted in empathy and equity. They’re innovating at the most fundamental level.\nThe demand is massive. Gainbridge Assists Powered by Parity received over 380 applications this year—more than double last year’s total. Each $5,000 grant seems modest, but the ripple effects are significant. In 1974, Billie Jean King founded the Women’s Sports Foundation with the $5,000 check she received for being named the Outstanding Female Athlete of the Year by the Bob Hope Cavalcade of Sports. In 2024, the program helped more than 5,000 girls pursue their athletic and academic goals. With this year’s expanded funding, the reach will only grow.\nTHE PATH FORWARD\nJust as the tech industry confronted its excuses about the so-called pipeline problem, we must confront ours in sports. We can no longer shrug and accept that girls “just drop out.” Not when we know the reasons, and not when the solutions are within reach.\nEquity in women’s sports must be defined broadly. It’s not just about broadcasting more games or negotiating better contracts—though those remain crucial. It’s also about removing the silent, practical, and cultural barriers that quietly push girls out long before they reach elite levels.\nKing famously said, “You have to see it to be it.” But before girls can see themselves as champions, they must be given the chance to stay on the field, the court, the track, or the ice. That requires meeting them where they are, addressing their most pressing needs, and ensuring they know they belong.\nLeela Srinivasan is CEO of Parity.",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417801/the-untapped-workforce-solving-industry-labor-shortages",
      "summary": "In today’s dynamic labor market, industries from manufacturing to healthcare continue to grapple with persistent workforce shortages. To fill these gaps, organizations are looking beyond traditional talent pools. One of the most promising yet significantly underutilized groups is second-chance talent, or graduates of prison education programs. These individuals represent millions of highly motivated and skilled professionals seeking stability after incarceration.\nToo often, outdated hiring methods and social stigmas have blocked justice-impacted individuals from employment opportunities that could change their lives. However, by shifting perspectives and implementing strategic programs, forward-thinking companies can access a dependable source of skilled workers while creating a positive social impact.\nTHE SCALE OF UNTAPPED POTENTIAL\nThe United States’ criminal justice system affects a much larger portion of the population than most realize. About 600,000 Americans are released from state and local prisons each year. This means nearly one in three or 70 million adults have a criminal record. Many of these individuals face obstacles when reentering society.  In a recent episode of Geographic Solutions’ podcast, The VOScast, Jeffrey Abramowitz, CEO of the Petey Greene Program, stated, “It is estimated that there are more than 44,000 barriers to employment for the formerly incarcerated, with 70% related to employment.”\nSecuring stable employment after prison is often the biggest challenge for justice-involved individuals. This is due to several factors, including a lack of education, nonexistent or inadequate job skills, and the stigma of having a criminal record, which often leads to higher rates of recidivism. According to the Safer Foundation, about 75% of justice-impacted individuals stay unemployed one year after their release. These barriers not only limit an individual’s potential but also represent a missed opportunity for employers facing labor shortages.\n“I think we’re missing an amazing opportunity right now in the country, and that opportunity is to recognize fair chance hiring or getting people who have been challenged in the Justice space back to work,” said Abramowitz in the podcast. “I also believe we’re missing an opportunity and not recognizing the reality that education plays a vital role in the United States.”\nBRIDGE SKILLS GAPS WITH TARGETED TRAINING PROGRAMS\nThe path to integrating individuals with a criminal record into the workforce begins with education and training. Reentry programs play a crucial role in helping justice-impacted individuals successfully reintegrate into society. They offer a variety of services tailored to meet the needs of those returning to the community.\nThese programs provide job training, educational opportunities, housing support, counseling, and soft and hard skills development. A study by the RAND Corporation found that reentry education programs may boost employment prospects post-release, with participants having a 13% higher chance of getting a job than non-participants.\n“Many of these individuals might struggle with reading, writing, and basic math, all of which are essential components for not only getting hired but also being able to advance their career,” said Abramowitz in the podcast. “When we talk about getting people back into employment and finding good opportunities for them, we also need to think about the integration of education and how we can set people up to succeed.”\nMany nonprofit organizations are creating tailored training programs to equip people with skills, knowledge, and opportunities that directly align with market needs. Organizations like the California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) have led innovative reentry initiatives, preparing justice-impacted individuals for productive lives outside of prison and reducing their chances of reoffending. A recent study from the University of California, Irvine found that individuals who have participated in CALPIA’s programs while incarcerated have lower rates of recidivism compared to those who did not participate. \nSimilarly, the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction is partnering with the Division of Workforce Solutions at the Department of Commerce for the North Carolina Pathway to Reentry. Using funds from the Pathway Home grant, the project provides pre- and post-release activities, including workshops, counseling, and training to help people transition out of incarceration and reenter their communities. It focuses on goal setting, action plans, education, and skill development for specific jobs. \nCreating easily accessible pathways for skill development and job training unlocks new opportunities that not only benefit those with a criminal background but also businesses that are looking to address labor shortages.\nBUILD BRIDGES WITH EMPLOYERS\nWith many industries facing skill and labor shortages, companies are recognizing the value of this untapped workforce. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, two in three HR professionals reported that their organization has hired individuals with criminal backgrounds. Moreover, 85% of HR leaders believe second-chance hires perform as well as or better than other employees.\nDespite this, some employers may hesitate to consider second-chance hiring due to concerns about liability, employee morale, perceived unreliability, and social stigmas. A recent survey from the Second Chance Business Coalition shows that almost 90% of employers mandate background checks for applicants, and having a criminal record decreases the likelihood of progressing to a second interview by half.\nTo successfully hire from this talent pool, employers must move beyond these stigmas and understand that second-chance hiring is more than a charitable act. By re-evaluating long-held hiring biases and actively engaging with this talent pool, organizations can transform a societal challenge into a strategic business advantage that benefits everyone.\nCompanies such as JPMorganChase and Dave’s Killer Bread are notable examples of organizations that have effectively implemented a second-chance employment model. JPMorganChase reports that almost 10% of their hires over the past five years have had a criminal record, and a third of Dave’s Killer Bread staff, including cofounder Dave Dahl, have felony convictions.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe way forward to addressing labor shortages involves a shift in how businesses perceive and engage with talent acquisition. It requires a proactive approach to recognize justice-impacted individuals as highly motivated and skilled professionals capable of contributing to the workforce.\nBy adopting inclusive hiring practices, companies can effectively fill labor gaps while also fostering a more diverse workplace. This strategy not only promotes economic growth by expanding the talent pool but also benefits local communities by offering opportunities for individuals to successfully reintegrate into society and attain long-term stability.\nPaul Toomey is the founder and president of Geographic Solutions.",

      "title": "What happens when online plane enthusiasts meet up IRL?",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417047/lax-plane-airlines-meet-up",
      "summary": "On a recent Saturday, several hundred people flocked to Los Angeles International Airport and spent most of the day looking at airplanes—all because they follow the same airline-industry blog. That sentence may require some explanation even if you’ve read a post or two on Cranky Flier, the commercial-aviation chronicle written by industry veteran Brett Snyder. \nThe “avgeek” gathering Snyder calls Cranky Dorkfest began in 2011. Snyder, based nearby in Long Beach, decided to see whether any of his readers—many of whom regularly show up in comments on his blog under aviation-related pseudonyms—wanted to meet up. He suggested a triangular park between LAX’s Runway 24R and an In-N-Out Burger that offers some of America’s finest plane spotting. \n“The original plan was really just me putting out a blog post saying that I was going to go to the park across from In-N-Out and hoped some people would join me for burgers, spotting, and conversation,” Synder says in an email. “A handful did. And then it just kept growing from there.”\nThe idea took off because the notion of people meeting online over a shared fascination and then connecting IRL shouldn’t be that strange. Especially if their meeting point happens to revolve around their common interest.\nSoon airlines, flight-tracking apps and services, and Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) started taking notice and finding ways to participate, perhaps because of or despite its self-mocking moniker of “Dorkfest.” (I got some raised eyebrows explaining the event to friends.)  \n“You have to own it,” says Snyder, whose job title at his travel agency, Cranky Concierge, is “president and chief airline dork.” \nPlane selfies\nThe 2025 edition of Dorkfest began early on September 13 at a ramp on the south side of the airport hosted by LAWA. The authority required attendees to register in advance; a week later, signups maxed out at 500.\nAttendees had the treat of two parked airliners to explore at length: American Airlines sent a Boeing 737-800 from its throwback “Astrojet” livery and Delta Air Lines loaned an Airbus A350-900. With almost everybody wanting a flight-deck selfie, boarding took awhile. \nLAWA catered breakfast from the local favorite Randy’s Donuts and brought a DJ, who spun location- and subject-relevant tracks like A Tribe Called Quest’s “I Left My Wallet in El Segundo” and the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Aeroplane.”\nA large fraction of the attendees ignored all of that to stand next to a fence separating the area from an active taxiway so they could take in the view of arrivals and departures on LAX’s two southern runways—plus a Boeing 747-8 freighter operated by Cathay Pacific Cargo taxiing nearby. \n“I hope people have travel plans soon” \nA few hours later, it was time to head over to the In-N-Out that’s become my favorite fast-food joint in the world. People opened ride-hailing apps for the short ride and waited for their Ubers and Lyfts to roll up, which is when I ran into a friend from grade and high school, an aviation lawyer I hadn’t seen since March of 2020.\nThe lunchtime scene at this In-N-Out is always great, since that block overlaps with the start of a wave of arrivals of wide-body jets from overseas. Even with a few hundred extra people added to the noon crowd, the place remained as marvelously efficient as I’ve seen it in past visits to L.A. \nAs attendees cycled their gaze from flight-tracking apps to each Boeing 777 or Airbus A350 arriving from places like Shanghai, Paris, Rome, or Singapore, Snyder conducted a raffle drawing, with prizes contributed by a flock of companies. \nStruggling to be heard over the roar of jet engines even with the help of a megaphone, Snyder cracked jokes as he called out winners of goodies such as a subscription to the aviation-industry publication The Air Current, free tickets or frequent-flyer miles from various airlines (“I hope people have travel plans soon,” he said while awarding 20,000 points from bankrupt Spirit Airlines), models of planes, and bundles of airline swag. \nOne airline had a formal presence: Recently merged Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines sent reps to hand out their inflight snacks of pretzel mix, Biscoff cookies, and POG (passionfruit orange guava) juice to any attendees not already stuffed from animal-style Double-Doubles.\nOther years have seen more in-person airline participation. Snyder recalls 2019’s Dorkfest, when Oscar Munoz, then-CEO of United Airlines, showed up and handed out burgers.\nThe day wrapped up with an event hosted by NYCAviation at a food hall called the Proud Bird, situated across Aviation Boulevard from LAX’s other pair of runways. The plane that drew the most cheers out from the audience was not any passenger airliner but a more esoteric airframe: a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 freighter operated by FedEx, the final version in a series of triple-engine wide-bodies dating to the DC-10.\nThat New York aviation-enthusiast group had started its own annual SpotLAX meetup a few years after Dorkfest began, then opted to align that gathering with Snyder’s.\n“We realized we should keep doing that,” Snyder says. “It really increased the opportunities for people to participate and helped justify travel from farther away to come join.”\nThe two farthest origin points for 2025’s Dorkfest, per a map at the Great Circle Mapper site generated from attendee input: Shizuoka, Japan, and Haikou, China.\nMost real-world meetups of online communities don’t draw people from that far away—with the exception of high-profile gatherings like the NASA Socials that the space agency hosts for launches. On one I joined for the penultimate space shuttle launch in 2011, I was struck by how readily strangers agreed to coordinate on shared housing and rental-car transportation. \nOften these gatherings are much smaller-scale, like Wikipedia-editor meetups, the weekly happy hours coordinated by some local Reddit forums (see, for example, those at r/washingtondc) or just two members of the FlyerTalk frequent-travel forum recognizing each other’s yellow “FT” luggage tags in an airport lounge.\nIt may be weird showing up to these events. But attendees tend to embrace the weirdness and the chance to get to know strangers who maybe aren’t so distant from them. \nAs Snyder says: “The best moments are meeting people who I’ve never seen other than in [a] discussion online.”",

      "summary": "A new study from the University of California, Berkeley, out October 8 in the journal Nature found that women are systematically presented as younger than men online and by artificial intelligence—based on an analysis of 1.4 million online images and videos, plus nine large language models trained on billions of words.\nResearchers looked at content from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr, and YouTube, plus major LLMs including GPT-2, and found women consistently appeared younger than men across 3,495 occupational and social categories. (Note: It’s possible that filters on videos and women’s makeup may be adding to this age-related gender bias in visual content.)\nStudy data showed not only are women systematically portrayed as younger than men across online platforms, but this distortion is strongest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. It also found that googling images of occupations amplified age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences.\n“This kind of age-related gender bias has been seen in other studies of specific industries and anecdotally . . . but no one has previously been able to examine this at such scale,” said Solène Delecourt, assistant professor at the Berkeley Haas School of Business, who coauthored the study with Douglas Guilbeault from Stanford’s business school and Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan from Oxford’s Autonomy Institute.\n“Even though the internet is wrong, when it tells us this ‘fact’ about the world, we start believing it to be true,” Guilbeault said. “It brings us deeper into bias and error.”\nLooking specifically at ChatGPT, researchers found when the AI chatbot generated and analyzed some 40,000 résumés, it assumed women were younger by 1.6 years and had less work experience, while rating older male applicants as more qualified—even though the data shows no systematic age differences between men and women in the workforce.\nBut perhaps the greatest takeaway from the study is that this biased view online reinforces inaccuracies about and stereotypes of women. When this distorted feedback loop between online perceptions and AI moves from the internet into the real world it can result in widening the gap between men and women in the job market.",

      "title": "Tesla took its shot—and missed",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91418228/tesla-affordable-standard-model-cars-missed-opportunity",
      "summary": "Too late. Too expensive. Too bland. Too antiquated. Too much of the same. There are just too many toos when it comes to Tesla’s new “cheap” cars, which the company announced on October 7. Its highly anticipated “affordable models” are just stripped-down Model 3 and Model Y variants that come in at a more expensive price point than the current 2025 models.\nSome marketing genius labeled them as “Standard,” but judging the cars against cheaper, better models from automakers around the world, Tesla’s newest offerings can’t even claim that benign adjective. The truth is, these cars are terrible news for the company. \n\n\n\n\nWith its reputation in tatters, thanks to Musk’s brand suicide-by-Trump and years of quality complaints, technology stagnation, and tired design, Tesla really needed a big bang to counteract its quickly shrinking market share. Judging by the reaction online, that big bang looks more like a Starship exploding on the launch pad.\nThe consensus is that these new models are just manufacturing cost-cutting without the price tag cuts. Unsurprisingly, Tesla stock fell 4% yesterday after the announcement. It will rebound, I’m sure, but my prediction is that it will crash way harder when new sales data comes in the next two quarters, after people realize how much of a dud these models are.\n\n\n\n\n[Photo: Tesla]\n\n\n\nCan’t compete\nThe Hyperloop-sized fact of the matter is that there is just no way these new cars are going to beat the competition. Let’s put aside their lackluster trimmings and repetitive design to focus on price for now. The new cars aren’t affordable at all: The Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, and the Model 3 Standard at $36,990. These prices can’t compete in the market today. \nChinese brands like BYD and Nio destroy them at every single metric. They already offer a better price for a superior technology than Tesla’s expensive models, which is why the company’s market share is in free fall everywhere Chinese EVs are on the road. Many Chinese models have longer-lasting and more durable batteries, better trimmings, better finishes, and even free autonomous driving for life for many models, at genuinely affordable prices.\n[Photo: BYD]\n\n\n\nWorldwide EV market king BYD sells vehicles starting below $30,000 globally, with models like the Dolphin priced at around $26,700 and the Seagull compact selling for under $10,000 in China. The company has outsold Tesla globally for the last four quarters, selling about 1.6 million all-electric vehicles through Q3 2025—nearly 400,000 more than Tesla’s 1.22 million units in the same period.\nBut you don’t even need to go compact to see the price difference: Nio’s new Onvo L60 SUV starts at $30,439 while offering more interior space and equivalent range. How can Tesla ever hope to beat them?\nEven American competitors offer better options. The Chevrolet Equinox EV starts at $34,995 with 319 miles of range, undercutting Tesla’s Model Y by $5,000 while offering traditional amenities Tesla removed. You know, like FM radio and powered mirrors. Tesla’s new models don’t have FM radio, and the new “Standard” Model 3 is now “the only car sold in America with manual side mirrors,” as the car publication The Drive points out.\n[Photo: Chevrolet]\n\n\n\nJapan has cheaper and better EVs, too, like the ​​Toyota bZ4X SUV, which starts at $38,520. The Europeans do, too, if you want something really inexpensive. The Dacia Spring starts at about $19,500. The Citroën ë-C3 begins at about $23,000. I can go on and on, but you get the idea. \nWorse yet: The new Teslas can’t even compete with the company’s existing models. Thanks to Musk’s Trump support—which brought the elimination of federal tax credits after September 30—the Standard models are more expensive than Tesla’s cars cost just days earlier, as EV car blog Electrek points out. The Model Y costs $37,490 after credits, about $2,000 less than the “Standard” version. Tesla somehow managed to launch “cheaper” cars that are more expensive. Well done, Elon. Here’s your $1 trillion cookie.\n[Photo: Tesla]\n\n\n\nDollar General cars without the price cuts\nThat’s the other thing with the new models. The company has systematically removed features across every category in these vehicles. The Model Y, for example, has dropped its range by 36 miles to 321 miles. Besides no more FM radio and powered mirrors, options like heated second-row seats and adaptive high beams are also no longer available. Cars.com counts a total of 15 missing features. \nGone are the LED light bars that were Tesla’s signature, according to The Autopian. The Model Y now looks like a generic crossover with simple headlamps. Inside, Tesla swapped premium vegan leather for cheap textile inserts, removed the rear touch screen that passengers actually used and kids loved, and even eliminated ambient lighting throughout the cabin. The audio system drops from 15 speakers with a subwoofer to just seven speakers. The rear seats fold manually instead of electronically. The front trunk shrinks by a cubic foot and loses its waterproof lining.\nThe engineering cutbacks are even more worrying. Tesla downgraded the suspension from its frequency-selective dampers back to basic passive shocks. Why? No idea. But it’s particularly shocking because the suspension has been a big point of disgust for many users and car testers, like MotorTrend, who hated it. \nGone is the lane-centering auto-steer, too, a major safety feature in a car brand known for being one of the most dangerous cars on the road. The number of cameras has been reduced, too. And, of course, no autonomous driving (which may be a blessing in disguise, given the deficient state of the technology, still far away from Musk’s self-driving sci-fi promises).\n[Photo: Tesla]\n\n\n\nAs one industry expert observed: “It’s challenging to justify such a lengthy list of missing features when the price difference is merely $5,000 from the next trim up.” As a Redditor pointed out in one of the many threads slamming the new models, it feels like Tesla doesn’t actually want to sell these cars—perhaps it’s a move to get consumers to upgrade to the next, more expensive model.\nIf that’s the case, it’s a strange way to get back into the leadership position. One that doesn’t seem to justify Musk’s astronomical pay package. Perhaps these new models are an admission that he has given up completely on cars, and he thinks that robots and autonomous cabs will save his company from oblivion. \nBut that bet is now more dangerous than ever. Maybe that would be a possibility if Tesla had all this technology working and deployed, but his promise about Tesla Robotaxis being everywhere in 2026 still feels completely unfeasible, no matter what some analysts are smoking. The company is still testing the cars in Austin and the Bay Area, while competitors Waymo and Apollo are establishing full services in cities worldwide.\nAnd Musk’s promise about Optimus also shipping by the gazillion next year. Well, LOL is all I can say. The latest demo in September was toe-curlingly embarrassing.\nBut I digress. We were talking about cars. We’re talking about new Teslas that are not affordable, but are cheap. But hey, at least they have arrived, even if it is years too late. And even if their arrival is nothing more than a reminder that Tesla is once again ceding its reputation as an innovator.",

      "summary": "If you’re a frequent flier, chances are you’ve been seized by the fear that your carry-on bag is too big for the overhead compartments.\nNow, for American Airlines passengers, it’s even more important to make sure that your bag is within the size limit before boarding. This week, the airline announced that it’s getting rid of its bag-sizers at gates.\nAmerican Airlines told the news station KTLA that it started removing the metal sizers, which typically allow customers and gate agents to decide if luggage will fit in the airplanes’ overhead bins, on October 6. \nAccording to the airline, the move is intended to simplify the boarding process—bypassing the bottleneck that sometimes forms when multiple passengers need to check the size of their bags.\nHow will bags be checked for size? \nStarting this week, gate agents will be responsible for visually assessing whether carry-ons are the appropriate size. \nAccording to American Airlines’ website, customers are allowed one personal item, which should be 18-by-14-by-8 inches or smaller, as well as one carry-on, which cannot exceed 22-by-14-by-9 inches. The airline noted to KTLA that bag-sizers are still available in airport lobbies for passengers who would like to use them.\n“Team members will continue to monitor carry-on baggage in the lobby and at the gate, and oversized items will still be required to be checked in ahead of the flight,” the airline said.\nThis procedural change is only the latest update in American Airlines’ recent effort to get passengers boarded faster. \nIn late 2024, the company began cracking down on “gate lice”—passengers who swarm the gate before it’s their time to board—by implementing a new boarding pass technology that makes an audible beep if fliers try to board in the wrong group, sending them back to the end of the line.\nOther airlines are increasingly focused on streamlining their boarding processes, too. \nOver the past several years, the air travel industry has become reliant on charging customers for an ever-expanding list of ancillary fees to boost profits, forcing the U.S.’s biggest companies to compete on offering the most desirable perks. For Southwest Airlines, that’s meant scrapping its iconic open boarding system in order to implement an eight-group boarding process with premium seating options.\nAmerican Airlines did not immediately respond to Fast Company’s request for additional details on its new bag-sizer policy.",

      "url": "https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/das-agile-ki-manifest-wie-gut-das-agile-manifesto-von-2001-gealtert-ist",
      "summary": "In Kürze: Das Agile KI Manifest — Wie gut das Agile Manifesto von 2001 gealtert ist\nDie agile Welt spaltet sich in zwei Lager: Diejenigen, die davon überzeugt sind, dass KI die Praktiker aus der Welt schaffen wird, und diejenigen, die KI als eine weitere Modeerscheinung abtun. Beide liegen falsch. Die Beweise zeigen etwas viel Interessanteres und Dringlicheres: Grundsätze, die 2001 verfasst wurden, bevor irgendjemand an GPT-Was-auch-immer dachte, stimmen bemerkenswert gut mit der transformativsten Technologie der letzten Jahre überein. Das ist kein Zufall. Ich glaube, es ist der Beweis dafür, dass menschenzentrierte Werte die technologische Disruption überdauern; es ist das Agile KI Manifest.\nWas beide Lager im Eifer der Diskussion übersehen, ist erhellend: Die größte Bedrohung ist nicht, dass KI die agilen Praktiker ersetzt. Es ist die KI, die offenbart, was viele Unternehmen schon immer vermutet haben. Sie haben nie agile Praktiker gebraucht. Sie brauchten jemanden, der Jira verwaltet.\nWenn Ihr Leistungsversprechen darin besteht, Zeremonien – ich bezeichne sie absichtlich nicht als „Events“ – durchzuführen, Produktbacklogs zu pflegen und Burndown-Diagramme zu erstellen, dann offenbart KI, dass Sie eine Arbeit verrichten, die das Unternehmen schon vor Jahren hätte automatisieren können. Die Trennung besteht zwischen Praktikern, die echte agile Arbeit leisten, und denen, die agiles Theater aufführen.\nKI ist ein Kompetenz-Detektor.\n\nDie falsche Debatte\nWenn Sie heute eine Veranstaltung der agilen Community besuchen, werden Sie auf zwei gegensätzliche Lager stoßen, die beide gleichermaßen überzeugt sind und gleichermaßen falsch liegen:\n\nDie KI-Maximalisten sagen die baldige Automatisierung von Scrum Mastern, Product Ownern und Agile Coaches voraus. Chatbots ersetzen Berater, Moderation wird auf Prompts reduziert und menschliches Urteilsvermögen wird überflüssig.\nDie KI-Ignoranten auf der anderen Seite tun das ganze Phänomen als „nur ein weiteres Metaverse“ ab, das dazu bestimmt ist, sich zu Web3 und NFTs auf den Technologiefriedhof zu gesellen.\n\nBeide Gruppen machen den gleichen Fehler. Sie behandeln KI entweder als vollständige Lösung oder als vollständige Fiktion. Sie verkennen, was in den Unternehmen tatsächlich gerade passiert: ein Wandel, der weder das menschliche Fachwissen ersetzt noch wieder in der Bedeutungslosigkeit verschwinden wird.\nWarum es dieses Mal wirklich anders sein könnte\nWeb3 und Krypto, die das traditionelle Finanzwesen ersetzen, und das Metaverse, das die menschliche Interaktion neu definiert: Beide Technologien waren Lösungen, die verzweifelt nach Problemen suchten. Ernsthaft: Zu keiner Zeit sind agile Praktiker aufgewacht und haben gedacht: „Wenn ich doch nur einen Blockchain-basierten Smart Contract für mein Sprint Goal hätte.“\nGenerative KI befasst sich mit Problemen, mit denen agile Praktiker bereits täglich konfrontiert sind, z. B. mit der Analyse und Kategorisierung großer Mengen von Kundenfeedback, der Erkennung von Mustern in Retrospektiven und dem Aufspüren von Marktveränderungen, die im Rauschen der Daten verborgen sind. Die Probleme waren zuerst da. KI bietet Lösungen.\nIn meiner Beratungspraxis nutzen Product Owner und Produktmanager KI, um Entdeckungszyklen um ein Vielfaches schneller abzuschließen, aber nur, wenn sie bereits wissen, welche Fragen sie stellen müssen. Retrospektiven, die sich auf KI-Mustererkennung über mehrere Sprints hinweg stützen, decken systemische Hindernisse auf, die bei einer manuellen Überprüfung oft übersehen werden. Bei diesen Effekten handelt es sich nicht um Vorhersagen, sondern um Messungen.\nDell’Acqua et al. (2025) bestätigten dies mit 776 Mitarbeitern von Procter & Gamble [1]. Einzelne Mitarbeiter mit KI erreichten die gleiche Leistung wie ganze Teams ohne KI. Teams mit KI produzierten mit deutlich höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit erstklassige Lösungen. Beide KI-gestützten Gruppen arbeiteten 12-16% schneller.\nDie Übereinstimmung, mit der niemand gerechnet hat\nDies macht die Beziehung des Agilen Manifests zur KI wirklich bemerkenswert: Die Grundsätze, die 2001 formuliert wurden, also vor dem Aufkommen von Smartphones, Cloud Computing und generativer KI, stimmen nahezu perfekt damit überein, wie generative KI im Jahr 2025 funktionieren wird.\nDie zuvor zitierte Studie bestätigt drei Muster, die beobachtbar sind. Diese Muster gehen über einzelne Anwendungsfälle hinaus und gelten für Scrum, Kanban und Extreme Programming:\nMuster Nr. 1: KI verbessert die Vorbereitung, der Mensch trifft die Entscheidungen\nDer Human-in-the-Loop-Ansatz: KI bereitet den Kontext vor, in welchem der Mensch entscheidet. KI analysiert kontinuierlich Feedback, deckt latente Bedürfnisse auf und fasst die Erkenntnisse zusammen. Aber der Mensch beurteilt, welche Erkenntnisse wichtig sind und entscheidet, was gebaut werden soll. Ohne dieses Fachwissen bleibt die von der KI erstellte Datensynthese nutzlos.\nKI hilft bei der Überprüfung des Codes und identifiziert Komplexität. Letztendlich entscheidet jedoch der Mensch, ob die Software die Probleme der Kunden effektiv löst. KI liefert Systemeinblicke. Aber die Teams müssen Kompromisse eingehen und organisatorische Beschränkungen beachten. Der Grundsatz des Manifests, dass „die besten Architekturen, Anforderungen und Entwürfe aus sich selbst organisierenden Teams hervorgehen“, bleibt intakt, da die Entscheidungsfindung bei Menschen bleibt, die den Kontext und die Beziehungen verstehen.\nMuster Nr. 2: Kontinuierliches Feedback wird vom Anspruch zur operativen Realität\n„Sich ändernde Anforderungen willkommen heißen, auch spät in der Entwicklung“ klingt unmöglich, denn das Erkennen von und Reagieren auf Veränderungen erfordert eine enorme Informationsverarbeitung. KI macht dieses Prinzip des Agilen Manifests in großem Maßstab umsetzbar.\nDie Zusammenarbeit mit den Kunden wird kontinuierlich statt periodisch, wenn KI Verhaltensmuster, Stimmungen und Supportgespräche in Echtzeit überwacht. Was früher vierteljährliche Forschungszyklen erforderte, geschieht jetzt wöchentlich oder täglich: Marktveränderungen werden durch KI-gestützte Mustererkennung in Datenquellen sichtbar, die für eine manuelle Analyse zu umfangreich sind.\nDie Teams treffen Anpassungsentscheidungen, die auf einer umfassenden Analyse und nicht auf einem Bauchgefühl beruhen. „Unsere oberste Priorität ist es, den Kunden zufrieden zu stellen“ wird von einer gut gemeinten Absicht zur operativen Realität, wenn Sie herausfinden, was den Kunden schneller zufrieden stellt als die Konkurrenz. (Ist das nicht die Essenz von „Agile“, schneller zu lernen als die Konkurrenz?)\nMuster Nr. 3: KI macht Gespräche von Angesicht zu Angesicht exponentiell wertvoller\nIm Agilen Manifest heißt es: „Das Gespräch von Angesicht zu Angesicht ist die effizienteste und effektivste Methode der Informationsübermittlung.“ KI ersetzt dies nicht. Sie macht es massiv wertvoller, indem sie die Informationsverarbeitung übernimmt, während der Mensch sich auf die Beurteilung, den Aufbau von Beziehungen und die gemeinschaftliche Entscheidungsfindung konzentriert.\nDie Scrum Master oder Agile Coaches, die mit einer KI-synthetisierten Analyse politischer Positionen zu Stakeholder-Meetings kommen, ersetzen nicht das Gespräch. Sie verwandeln diese jedoch von einer Informationsbeschaffung in strategische Verhandlungen. KI kann die fünf wichtigsten Problempunkte identifizieren. Sie kann aber nicht den Raum während eines angespannten Meetings lesen und wissen, wann man pushen und wann man sich zurückziehen sollte. Das zu wissen, ist Ihr Vorteil.\nDell’Acqua et al. (2025) [1] fanden heraus, dass Menschen, die KI nutzen, über mehr positive und weniger negative Emotionen berichten. Wenn KI die Informationsverarbeitung entlastet, können sich die Menschen besser auf die Beziehungsarbeit konzentrieren. Teams, die KI zur Kundenanalyse einsetzen, führen mehr Gespräche, nicht weniger. Das Agile Manifest hat es richtig gesagt: Das menschliche Gespräch ist unersetzlich.\nDie konträre Position, die niemand vertritt\nDies ist, was beide Lager übersehen: Die größte Bedrohung ist nicht, dass KI die agilen Praktiker ersetzt. Es ist die KI, die offenbart, was viele Unternehmen schon immer vermutet haben. Sie haben nie agile Praktiker gebraucht. Sie brauchten jemanden, der Jira verwaltet.\nWenn Ihr Leistungsversprechen darin besteht, Zeremonien – ich bezeichne sie absichtlich nicht als „Events“ – durchzuführen, Produktbacklogs zu pflegen und Burndown-Diagramme zu erstellen, dann offenbart KI, dass Sie eine Arbeit verrichten, die das Unternehmen schon vor Jahren hätte automatisieren können. Die Trennung besteht zwischen Praktikern, die echte agile Arbeit leisten, und denen, die agiles Theater aufführen. KI ist ein Kompetenz-Detektor.\nDas Agile KI Manifest: KI kann den Raum nicht lesen (und das ist Ihr Vorteil)\nKI kann Support-Tickets analysieren und die fünf wichtigsten Schmerzpunkte identifizieren. Sie kann den Raum während eines angespannten Stakeholder-Meetings jedoch nicht lesen und weiß nicht, wann sie drängen und wann sie sich zurückziehen sollte, da es ihr an Einfühlungsvermögen und Verständnis für die aktuelle Unternehmenspolitik und die persönliche Agenda der Stakeholder fehlt. KI kann keine psychologische Sicherheit aufbauen, die es den Teams erlaubt, zuzugeben, dass sie die Architektur nicht verstehen. KI kann den Widerstand der Organisation nicht überwinden, da sie nicht versteht, welche Interessengruppen Daten benötigen, wer Geschichten braucht und wer politisch gedeckt werden muss.\nDiese Fähigkeiten (Kontext lesen, Vertrauen aufbauen, schwierige Gespräche führen, die Politik steuern) sind Ihr Trumpf. KI macht diese Trennung absolut. Ein mittelmäßiger Fachmann, der mit KI ausgestattet ist, bleibt mittelmäßig, produziert aber jetzt schneller mittelmäßige Ergebnisse. Ein Experte, der mit KI ausgestattet ist, wird deutlich effektiver.\nWarum „Good Enough“ Agile gerade gestorben ist\nEin erfahrener Product Owner, der KI einsetzt, kann heute zehn Positionierungshypothesen in der Zeit testen, die zuvor für eine oder zwei benötigt wurde. Ein erfahrener Scrum Master kann die Teamdynamik in sechs Retrospektiven analysieren, um systemische Hindernisse zu identifizieren, die bei einer manuellen Überprüfung wahrscheinlich übersehen würden.\nDie Ära des „gut genug Agile“ geht zu Ende, denn „gut genug“ Praktiker können die Möglichkeiten der KI nicht voll ausschöpfen. Unternehmen, die den Wert dieses Effekts erkennen, investieren in die strukturierte Entwicklung von KI-Fähigkeiten für Experten. Fachwissen plus KI schafft einen Wettbewerbsvorteil. KI ohne Fachwissen erzeugt teuren Lärm. Diese Tatsache führt übrigens zu einer überwältigenden Zahl von Anmeldungen in meiner Oktober-Kohorte, mit einer Warteliste von über 6.000 Teilnehmern.\nWas am Montagmorgen zu tun ist\nDie strategische Frage „Wird KI mich bereichern oder ersetzen?“ ist weniger wichtig als die taktische Frage: „Was tue ich diese Woche, um sicherzustellen, dass KI meine Fähigkeiten erweitert?“ Anbei einige Vorschläge, um Ihre Überlegungen in Gang zu bringen:\nDas Agile KI Manifest für Scrum Master:\nErfassen Sie Ihre letzten drei Retrospektiven. Verwenden Sie KI, um deren Protokolle oder Notizen zu analysieren und Muster zu erkennen, die Sie manuell übersehen hätten. Entwerfen Sie dann ein Moderationsexperiment auf der Grundlage dieser Erkenntnisse. Der Wert liegt nicht in der KI-Analyse. Es geht darum, ob Sie sie in eine bessere Moderation umsetzen können. Wenn Sie das nicht können, offenbart die KI eine Lücke in Ihrem Fachwissen.\nFür Produktverantwortliche und Produktmanager:\nNehmen Sie Ihre letzten 100 Kunden-Support-Tickets oder Benutzer-Feedback-Einträge. Verwenden Sie KI, um Muster zu synthetisieren und die fünf wichtigsten latenten Bedürfnisse zu identifizieren. Nehmen Sie sich dann eine Stunde Zeit, um mit Ihren Entwicklern zu besprechen, ob diese Bedürfnisse mit Ihrer Produktstrategie übereinstimmen und wie Sie diese validieren würden. Wenn Sie dieses Gespräch nicht effektiv führen können, zeigt die KI, dass Sie die Grundlagen der Produktfindung nicht verstehen.\nFür Agile Coaches:\nNehmen Sie Ihren aktuellen Kundenauftrag. Nutzen Sie KI, um die verfügbaren Unternehmensdaten zu analysieren, einschließlich Besprechungsmuster, Kommunikationsflüsse und Entscheidungsdynamik. Identifizieren Sie ein systemisches Hindernis, das Sie zuvor nicht erkannt haben. Entwickeln Sie dann eine Maßnahme, um dieses Problem zu lösen. Wenn Sie diese Intervention nicht entwerfen können, zeigt Ihnen die KI, dass Sie Playbooks und kein Coaching liefern.\nDas Agile Manifest hat diesen Moment vorausgesagt, indem es etwas Zeitloses erkannt hat: Technologie dient den Menschen, nicht umgekehrt. Die Praktiker, die erfolgreich sind, werden diejenigen sein, die dieses Prinzip in dieser Woche umsetzen, nicht erst in Zukunft.\nDie Frage, die sich jeder Praktiker stellen sollte, ist einfach: Werde ich dies als Hype abtun, es als Ersatz annehmen oder lernen, es als Verstärkung zu nutzen?\nWer sich auf diesen Wandel vorbereitet, investiert in die strukturierte Entwicklung von Fähigkeiten, die wir ab dem 13. Oktober erforschen werden.\nDas agile KI Manifest — ein Fazit\nDas Agile Manifest bleibt nicht trotz, sondern wegen der KI relevant. Die Autoren des Manifests haben etwas richtig gemacht: Prinzipien, die auf menschlichen Bedürfnissen aufbauen, überleben technologische Veränderungen. KI verstärkt das, was Sie mitbringen: Bringen Sie Fachwissen, Urteilsvermögen und die Fähigkeit, mit menschlicher Komplexität umzugehen, mit und KI macht Sie effektiver. Bringen Sie nur mechanische Kompetenz mit und KI wird zeigen, dass Sie schon immer ersetzbar waren.\nSie haben die Wahl. Wählen Sie weise.\nLiteratur\n[1] Dell’Acqua, F., Ayoubi, C., Lifshitz-Assaf, H., Sadun, R., Mollick, E. R., Mollick, L., Han, Y., Goldman, J., Nair, H., Taub, S., & Lakhani, K. R.

      "title": "Product Ownership and Product Management - Are these Two, Two Different Extremes?",
      "url": "https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/product-ownership-and-product-management-are-these-two-two-different-extremes",
      "summary": "Taking a leaf out of fellow PST Sander Dur’s recent post, I would like to explore if Product Ownership and Product Management are mutually exclusive or inclusive. I personally like his analogy that the Product Owner and the Product Manager are just two different t-shirts. Now, different people have different PoVs on the two, I will be sharing my learning and experiences in this post.\n\nWhat’s a Product?\nLet’s start with the very basics. A Product is anything that creates a desired outcome for its user or a desired impact for its producer. For ex:  A camera is a product. For a photographer like me, it helps to capture moments; while for an OEM like Nikon, it generates RoI.\nWhy is this important?\nWe all are aware that Scrum was introduced to the larger world in the 90s and it was meant for software product development. But we all also can agree that software applications are not the only products that exist and Scrum is not the only approach to create or build a product. If I go back to my camera example, Nikon as a company was incorporated in 1917 and cameras were getting created much before Scrum existed. Which means that someone must be doing all the work from ideation to delivery of cameras to the end user. Who is that person? I will leave you with that question for the next couple of minutes.\nAnd in the meantime, let me put forth another question - \nWho is a Product Owner?\nAs per the Scrum Guide 2020 version:\n\nScrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.\n                                          \nThe Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. \n\nSo Product Owner is an accountability within the Scrum Team, who is accountable to maximize the value of Product. \nAnd how does the Product Owner maximize the value of the product? Scrum states - it may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams and individuals. In short, Scrum has no say in how a Product Owner does their job.\nWhat does it take to make a Product Valuable?\nWhen I was learning the ropes of Product Ownership from my dear friend and colleague Sumeet Madan, he introduced me to the Product Quadrant. I think some of you might have come across it. It looks as below:\n\n \nNow as you can see in the image, there is Strategy and Operations, and either of them can be Internal as well as external. And there are so many activities which need to be performed. And many (if not all) of these activities have existed since we started creating products. So who would do these activities? And this takes us back to the earlier question - who is that person who does the work from ideation to the delivery of the product? \nWell, the answer is pretty simple. All the activities that we see in the quadrant are related to Product Management and so a person who is adept at these activities is called a Product Manager.\nThen where does the Product Owner fit in?\nWell, you see in the Product quadrant, most activities that are mentioned within the Internal-Operations quadrant were traditionally taken care of by a role called as “Project Manager”. When the agile moment happened and Scrum started to become the de-facto approach to product delivery; the typical responsibilities of the project manager were shared across the three accountabilities within the Scrum Team. The other three quadrants still were taken care by the person called Product Manager, as depicted in the following images:\n\n              \n \n\n \nHowever, if a Product Owner really has to maximize the value of the product then this person cannot be disconnected from the rest of the three quadrants. In order to really take the ownership of the Product and its value maximization, a Product Owner has to be across all the quadrants and thereby all the activities that may fall under each of them. All these activities originate in Product Management and so a Product Owner needs to be a “pro” at Product Management.\n \n\n \nAnd a person who is a “pro” at Product Management is usually known as a Product Manager. So in other words a Product Owner is just the Product Manager wearing a different t-shirt as highlighted by Sander Dur in his post.\nConclusion: \nIn my personal experience, in many large organizations both the Product Owner and Product Manager co-exist. And often their responsibilities are divided. One is more internal facing while the other is external facing. \nNow there is a catch, you might have a Product Owner if and only if you are using Scrum as your approach to Product Development, if you don’t use Scrum then you do not need a Product Owner in your team or organization; a Product Manager will do.\nAlso, if you do use Scrum for Product Development then a Product Manager could be an organizational designation while Product Owner could be an accountability on a Scrum Team and both could be the same person.\n \nP.S. If you are interested to learn more about Product Ownership then you can always join one of our Product Ownership courses.",
