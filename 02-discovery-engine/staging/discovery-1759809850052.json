      "summary": "October Prime Day is on the horizon, so it’s time to start thinking about what you may want to snag at a discount during the sale tomorrow. If you pay the $139 annual fee for Prime, sale events like these are a great time to stock up on essentials and cross things off your wishlist while you can save some money.\nMost discounts will be exclusively available to Prime subscribers, but there are always a few that anyone shopping on Amazon can grab. Similarly, there are always early deals in the days and weeks leading up to Prime Day, and this year is no different. Here, we’ve collected the best Prime Day deals you can shop for right now and we’ll keep updating this post as we get close to Prime Day proper.\n \nOctober Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks\n \n \n \nApple AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $90 (30 percent off): Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are the best AirPods for folks on a budget. They have an open-ear design that some will prefer over eartips that stick into your ears full, plus they have much improved audio quality and the H2 chip that enables features like Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ.\n  \nApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life.\n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level.\n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are.\n \nOctober Prime Day deals on tech\n \n \n \nApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.\n \nJLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 (42 percent off): These ultra-affordable wireless earbuds are 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the previous model, and they have a mobile app in which you can choose from three preset EQ modes to customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours, and they come with three different sizes of eartips so you can get the best fit.\n \nLego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.\n \nAnker 622 5K magnetic foldable power bank with stand for $34 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.\n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Blink makes some of our favorite security cameras, and the Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring. It can be placed outside with the right weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nJBL Go 4 portable speaker for $40 (20 percent off): The Go 4 is a handy little Bluetooth speaker that you can take anywhere you go thanks to its small, IP67-rated design and built-in carrying loop. It'll get seven hours of playtime on a single charge, and you can pair two together for stereo sound.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E. It also has double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks.\n \nAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 (44 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.\n \nAnker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $63 (22 percent off, Prime exclusive): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones.\n \n \n \nLevoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $70 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\n \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off): This entry-level robot vacuum is an upgraded version of one of our favorite budget robot vacuums. iRobot makes robovacs that are easy to use, even for those who have never had a machine like this, and they do a good job of cleaning up all kinds of messes, including pet hair.\n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \nShark Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): If you're looking for an autonomous dirt-sucker that can also mop, this is a good option. It has a mopping pad and water reservoir built in, and it supports home mapping as well. Its self-emptying base can hold up to 60 days worth of debris, too.\n \nAmazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen.\n \nXReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear.\n \nNintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-58-percent-off-on-apple-samsung-lego-dyson-shark-and-others-before-the-sale-begins-050801654.html?src=rss",

The bad news is that the company's upcoming game, Mina the Hollower, has been delayed from its planned October 31 release date. But the good news is that it doesn't seem like this will be a lengthy wait. \nThere's no new launch date given in the post on the developer's website, but Yacht Club says that it won't be much longer before the game is ready. \"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet,\" the post states. \"This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.\" Mina the Hollower is coming to life thanks to a successful Kickstarter by the team during 2022. It's an action-adventure game with nods to the Game Boy Color's aesthetics. \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mina-the-hollower-from-the-makers-of-shovel-knight-has-been-delayed-222817866.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "After several silent months, Bungie has opened applications for players interested in participating in a closed technical test of Marathon. It's an invitation-only limited-time test, lasting just October 22-28. Those who are chosen to participate can only do so under a non-disclosure agreement, so don't expect to hear any juicy details or insights about the game's status later this month once the event wraps. \nWhile it's not a new public look at Marathon, news of a fresh round of testing marks a small step forward for this team extraction shooter. The game was originally slated for a September 2025 release, but in June, Bungie said it was indefinitely delaying the project. The pause was meant to give the studio time to address player feedback from the closed alpha test it conducted earlier in the spring. Considering the language used for this testing phase, we'll still have a while to wait before getting a new launch window. \nWhenever it does arrive, Marathon will be Bungie's first new title since the company introduced Destiny 2 back in 2017. Before the delay, the studio had also drawn raised eyebrows with Marathon after the alpha build used stolen artwork, which has been a repeat issue for Bungie. \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bungie-will-conduct-technical-testing-on-marathon-later-this-month-213422857.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "You’ll soon be able to interact with some of your favorite apps, including Spotify and Canva, right inside of ChatGPT.  OpenAI announced the integration, which is enabled by the company’s new  Apps SDK, during its DevDay presentation. As of today, ChatGPT can connect to a handful of apps, with more to come over time and OpenAI working on submission guidelines that will allow developers to monetize their work. \nAs a ChatGPT user, you can any access available third-party app by referencing it in your conversations with the chatbot. In the case of Spotify, for example,  you can write “Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday.” The first time you mention an app in this way, you’ll be prompted to connect your account to ChatGPT. When working with Spotify, ChatGPT can make recommendations based on a mood, theme or a topic. The interface will eventually lead you to Spotify itself, where you can listen to what ChatGPT has created. \n\n\n\n“It’s early days, so while we might not be able to deliver on every request just yet, we’ll continue to build, refine, and improve the experience over the coming weeks and months,” Spotify says of the integration.\nOpenAI showed off other apps working inside of ChatGPT. For instance, an employee demoed Canva creating a few posters for a dog-walking business that they had talked to ChatGPT about starting. With today’s announcement, ChatGPT can connect to Canva, Coursera, Figma, Spotify and Zillow. In the coming weeks, DoorDash, OpenTable, Target and Uber will also work with the chatbot. And later this year, OpenAI says it will begin accepting app submissions for review and publication. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canva-and-other-apps-can-now-connect-to-chatgpt-194830116.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "The reaction to iPadOS 26 has been mostly positive, but some users have bemoaned the absence of the decade-old Slide Over multitasking feature. Well, Apple just announced that it's coming back as part of iPadOS 26.1. It's actually already available, though just as part of the beta build.\nFor the uninitiated, Slide Over is a multitasking tool that lets users quickly reveal and hide an app that slides in and out from the side of the screen. This is great for quickly revealing and hiding an app without permanently rearranging your workspace.\n\nApple also got rid of Split View with iPadOS 26, but the new windowing system can easily do something similar. There has been no way with the new OS to mimic Slide Over, which has become a source of frustration for tablet fans.\n\nWhoa, Apple brought back Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1 Beta 2 and, unlike before, you can now resize it instead of just being a skinny window like it was on iPadOS 18 and earlier.  It’s basically now just a way to pin an app on top of every other app. pic.twitter.com/tHZk0DAkRk\n— Robb Weeks (@jrobertweeks) October 6, 2025\nSlide Over has been redesigned to work with that new windowing system and there's a major upgrade. Users can quickly resize the windows and change the aspect ratios, in addition to swiping right to completely hide them from view.\nThere is also one major downgrade, according to reporting by 9to5Mac. Users can only have one active app in Slide Over at a time. In iPadOS 18 (and earlier), folks could switch between multiple apps in a Slide Over window, but it looks like that option has been removed. \nGiven how iPadOS 26 radically reworked the way the system handles multiple apps, it's a safe bet that this old Slide Over behavior was incompatible with the latest OS. Engadget has reached out to Apple for clarification and will update this post when we hear back.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apple-is-bringing-back-slide-over-in-ipados-261-190036025.html?src=rss",

      "url": "https://www.engadget.com/evernotes-biggest-update-since-2020-goes-all-in-on-ai-180000340.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "If you're like me, it's probably been a hot minute since you've thought about Evernote. For years, the note-taking app, once a darling of the App Store, faced declining popularity and profitability. The last time it grabbed headlines was in 2022 when it was sold to Milan-based developer Bending Spoons. Approximately nine months later, Bending Spoons laid off nearly all of Evernote's US workforce, and relocated what remained of the company's operations to Europe. Now, Evernote wants to be in the conversation again. \nSince taking over the app, Bending Spoons has released more than 200 improvements, culminating today with the release of Evernote v11. The company is touting the update, which is the first major release for Evernote since its poorly received v10 release back in 2020. The new version brings a handful of new AI features to Evernote, including one that Bending Spoons collaborated with OpenAI to develop.      \n\"My wish for v11 is that people give it a try and see how fast and reliable it is, how complete it is in what it offers,\" Federico Simionato, Evenote's product lead, said over a video chat. \"I think people have an outdated opinion of Evernote that used to match reality, when Evernote was slow and unreliable.\"    \nThe first of the new features Bending Spoons is introducing today is called AI Assistant. Simionato describes it as having ChatGPT inside of Evernote. No surprise since the company collaborated with OpenAI to make it. As you can probably guess, you can use AI Assistant to search through your notes and notebooks, but the tool's utility goes beyond that. It allows you to interact with your documents and ask follow-up questions. AI Assistant can also generate new content, and you can decide how what it creates is integrated within your existing notes and notebooks. In my demo, Simionato used AI Assistant to add a flight ticket number to a note he had dedicated to an upcoming trip to Spain. Over time, Bending Spoons plans to make AI Assistant more powerful, with the company working on making it possible for the chatbot to assign tags to notes and perform bulk actions across multiple documents, among other capabilities. \nBy default, Bending Spoons will enable AI Assistant for all paid users. A set of granular controls will allow people to decide what content AI Assistant can access. The agreement Bending Spoons has with OpenAI means the company can't train its models on data from Evernote users. Additionally, any data sent to the cloud for processing will only be held as long it takes to complete the user's request.  \nPart of the reason Bending Spoons is taking a more forward approach with AI Assistant is due to user feedback. In 2023, the company released a tool called AI Search. Simionato says his team was \"extremely careful\" to add friction to the experience to ensure people felt Evernote was respecting their privacy. To that end, you had to dig into the app's settings to enable AI Search before it would work. According to Simionato, users found that setup was \"too cumbersome,\" and with most people becoming more comfortable with AI tools, the company decided to make AI Assistant visible from the jump. \nThe other new feature Bending Spoons is introducing today is one some Evernote users have been waiting for a decade: Semantic Search. Instead of trying to find a note using an exact word or phrase you used inside of it, Semantic Search allows Evernote to filter through your documents using context. Simionato demonstrates the feature in action by typing \"Barcelona trip\" into the new interface, and Evernote surfaces a note he created about a trip to Girona. If you're not familiar, Girona is a city about 62 miles northeast of Barcelona and part of Catalonia. The document Evernote pulled up had no mention of Barcelona in it, but that didn't prevent the tool from finding it. According to Simionato, this is the most requested feature of longtime Evernote users and one Bending Spoons is happy it can finally deliver on. \nLastly, the company has expanded the app's built-in recording and transcription capabilities. Building on AI Transcribe, which Bending Spoons first introduced in 2024, Evernote can now record audio from both in-person and online meetings and automatically transcribe and summarize what's said. This feature should work in every language that Evernote currently supports. \nAs mentioned, Evernote's new AI features are available to all paid users. The features will roll out to desktop and web first starting this month, with mobile to follow. Simionato said Bending Spoons is working on making a trail available to free users sometime in the next few months. For now, the price of Evernote's paid plans isn't going up, but Simionato noted the company plans to adjust pricing in the coming months, mostly to account for the fact there aren't many notable differences between the Personal and Professional tiers. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/evernotes-biggest-update-since-2020-goes-all-in-on-ai-180000340.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "Robot vacuums are more than just a gimmick. Sure, we all enjoy anthropomorphizing a Roomba from time to time, but they're not gadgets for the sake of gadgetry — keeping your living space clean is an incredibly rewarding task to automate. The only problem is that robot vacuums, and frankly all decent vacuums, are expensive. Fortunately, the steep discounts offered on Amazon this October Prime Day make the purchase a lot more justifiable, whether you want a robot buddy or a traditional vacuum cleaner. In this article, we're sharing a constantly updated list of Prime Day vacuum deals worth taking advantage of.\n \nBest Prime Day robot vacuum deals\n \n \n \nDyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are.\n  \nDyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $410 (38 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in.\n \nShark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $459 (29 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work.\n \nShark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (55 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into.\n \nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors.\n \nShark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty.\n \niRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more.\n \niRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (36 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely.\n \nRoborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app.\n \nBest Prime Day vacuum deals\n \n \n \nLevoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge.\n \nShark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets.\n \nAmazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $55 (21 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean.\n \nBlack+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "You can snap up a lot of useful tech for less than $50 during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale. We’re seeing discounts on streaming devices, mini speakers, earbuds, power banks, wall chargers, and more. But this isn’t just random drek. The deals highlighted here are pulled from our own guides and reviews —these are gadgets and accessories we’ve tried ourselves and currently recommend. If you’re looking for small electronics and accessories (or if you just want to fill your Amazon cart without spending too much) this list of the best Prime Day deals under $50 is a great place to start.\n \nBest Prime Day deals under $50\n \n \n \nUGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $45 ($11 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip.\n  \nInstant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen.\n \nAmazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. It’s good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+.\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator.\n \nBlink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price.\n \nRing Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. \n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.\n \nBlink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark.\n \n \n \nLego Star Wars: The Mandalorian Paz Vizsla and Moff Gideon Battle for $17 (56 percent off): You can have a tiny version of the dramatic season-three battle from The Mandalorian to admire whenever you want. This 289-piece set is rated for kids seven and up, but no one will judge if you keep it for your own shelves.\n \nCheck out more Lego sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals.\n \nAnker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $34 ($14 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.\n \nRing Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events.\n \nAmazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.\n \nLevoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room.\n \n8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $45 ($25 off): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50.\n \nEcho Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more.\n \nRoku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it.\n \n \n \nLeebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 ($30 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.\n \nJisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.\n \nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.\n \nAmazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year.\n \nSamsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.\n \nRing Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount.\n \nAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 ($35 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.\n \nJLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Natron’s Failure May Not Spell Doom for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/natron-sodium-ion-battery-failure",
      "summary": "Natron Energy, a Santa Clara, California-based sodium-ion battery startup, ceased operation on 3 September due to funding issues. Just a year ago, the company made headlines for its plans to build a first-of-its-kind US $1.4 billion factory in North Carolina to manufacture up to 14 gigawatt-hours of sodium-ion batteries. While experts say Natron’s closure shouldn’t be taken as a harbinger for the rest of the emerging industry in the United States, they acknowledge that the West is behind China, which is leveraging its dominance in lithium-ion batteries to forge ahead on sodium-ion battery manufacturing.\nIn the U.S., sodium-ion startups like Natron, which launched in 2012, tend to rely on goodwill from funders, says K.M. Abraham, a retired research professor at Northeastern University in Boston and CTO of lithium-ion battery consulting firm E-KEM Sciences. This can pose challenges for companies when funding timelines outpace innovations.\n“Companies aren’t able to make progress quickly enough to keep up with pressure exerted by the investors,” he says.\nNatron’s Pioneering Prussian Blue Batteries\nUntil recently, Natron was seen as a leader of the pack in the U.S. sodium-ion market. Part of the company’s appeal was its pioneering approach to low-cost electrodes, the conductors at the battery’s positive and negative terminals, which make contact with the non-metallic part of the circuit. The company used Prussian Blue, a pigment found in paints and dyes, to make both the cathode and anode for its three battery systems. In addition to having a low material cost, Prussian Blue’s chemical structure has large pores, helping it facilitate faster ion transfer between the electrodes.\nNatron was the first in the world to commercialize a sodium-ion battery using Prussian Blue, a real feat considering China’s battery manufacturing might, says Tyler Evans, co-founder and CEO of Mana Battery, a Broomfield, Colorado-based sodium-ion battery cell startup that launched in 2023.\n“They were doing it in the West, and they were scaling a technology that was relatively low energy density for a very specific market segment,” says Evans about Natron’s products.\n  Mana is another U.S. startup focusing on bringing sodium-ion batteries to market.Nicholas Singstock/Mana\nThat market included grid storage, data center power backups, and electric vehicle charging stations—large-scale stationary applications where attributes like safety and cost rank higher than energy density. Natron’s success in this space, including its plans for the North Carolina factory, prompted questions about whether sodium-ion could emerge as a direct replacement for lithium-ion batteries. United Airlines and Chevron were on the list of Natron’s investors.\nBut Evans says scaling up a low-energy density product while building out manufacturing lines is expensive. “If you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce 10 gigawatt hours of batteries, if your energy density is very low, producing an equivalent number of batteries requires more manufacturing lines,” Evans says.\n“If you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce a gigawatt-hour of battery manufacturing capacity, if your energy density per battery cell is very low, producing that capacity requires more manufacturing lines,” Evans says, meaning significantly more capital and operational expenditure in an already capital-intensive undertaking.\nIn 2023, Natron’s systems made it to market. The company partnered with Encorp to deploy the industry’s first multi-megawatt class power platform for industrial applications. A year later, in 2024, Natron opened the U.S.’s first commercial scale manufacturing facility in Holland, Michigan to supply data centers with energy storage. The U.S. Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program provided $19.8 million to Natron as part of a $300 million facility upgrade to transition from lithium-ion battery manufacturing to sodium-ion battery manufacturing. That facility shut its doors at the same time as Natron’s California headquarters on 3 September.\nA request for comment from Natron resulted in an automated message to contact the company’s primary shareholder, Sherwood Partners. Sherwood Partners did not respond to a request for comment.\nSodium-Ion vs. Lithium-Ion Battery Costs\nAdrian Yao is the founder and team lead of Stanford’s STEER initiative, a DOE-funded research program. He’s also an author of a January 2025 paper assessing how sodium-ion batteries measure up to lithium-ion batteries in terms of technology and cost.\nWhile he was impressed with Natron’s technology and product, he says that the company may have been ahead of the curve on the data center market niche it had carved out for itself. “Hyperscalers right now, their primary concern is just getting connected and building data centers,” says Yao. “I think timing on that cycle may be early, and it’s unfortunate things don’t always work out.”\nNatron joins Stanford spin-out Bedrock Materials as the second sodium-ion company to fold this year. Bedrock cited market and innovation challenges for its April closure.\n“The battery business is very difficult. There are a lot of tombstones,” says Andrew Thomas, president and cofounder of Acculon Energy, a Columbus, Ohio-based startup marketing two battery modules with sodium-ion cells for industrial energy and EVs that travel at low speeds, like golf carts. Unlike Natron, Acculon, which launched in 2022, employs more traditional layered-metal oxides and other sodium chemistries.\nThomas says it’s this distinction that makes it hard to draw conclusions about the U.S. sodium-ion battery industry as a whole in light of Natron’s closure. Comparing different sodium-ion chemistries, like Prussian Blue or layered metal oxides, is like comparing apples to oranges.\n“I don’t think one failure is representative of a country being unable, but we’re at a significant disadvantage given the installed base in China,” Thomas says.\n  China is the dominant player in sodium-ion battery development, with companies like CATL displaying their designs at tech expos.Yuan Zheng/VCG/AP\nChina’s Dominance in Battery Manufacturing\nChina has long dominated the battery industry, and sodium-ion batteries are no exception. Today, China produces more than 75 percent of batteries sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency. On the sodium-ion front, developers like CATL have moved into second-generation batteries, with the April launch of Naxtra, a brand geared toward EV applications.\nYao says he’d like to see the U.S. concentrate its focus more on building up its manufacturing prowess to compete with China. “My broader critique of the Western Hemisphere in terms of our thinking and obsession with trying to innovate ourselves out of the problem, is that we focus too much on tech,” Yao says. “We have very little manufacturing experience… Our yield rates are abysmal, and our workforce is not trained.”\nFounders like Evans and Thomas are optimistic about their prospects as growing demand for grid storage, data centers, and low-cost mobility applications drives the need for applications they say sodium-ion batteries are uniquely equipped to support in terms of temperature range, safety, and cost metrics. When it comes to manufacturing, Mana is taking a page from China’s playbook by partnering with existing manufacturers to scale up production.\nEvans says there’s an appetite for this kind of partnership in the U.S. right now. “I think it’s a commercialization sweet spot that’s specific to sodium.”",

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/multiphysics-simulation-power-grid",
      "summary": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by COMSOL.\nSimulation software is useful in the analysis of new designs for improving power grid resilience, ensuring efficient and reliable power distribution, and developing components that integrate alternative energy sources, such as nuclear fusion and renewables. The ability to simulate multiple physical phenomena in a unified modeling environment gives engineers a deeper understanding of how different components of the grid interact with and affect each other.\nFor example, when designing the various components of grid infrastructure, such as transformers and transmission lines, multiphysics electromagnetic field analysis is essential for ensuring the safety of the surrounding individuals and environment. Understanding thermal behavior, another phenomenon involving multiple physics, is equally necessary for the design of grid components where heat dissipation and thermal stresses can significantly affect performance and lifespan. Structural and acoustics simulation, meanwhile, is used to predict and mitigate issues like transformer vibration and noise — an important practice for ensuring the longevity and reliability of grid components.\nMultiphysics simulation provides critical insight into the complex interactions at play within power grid components, enabling engineers to virtually test and optimize future grid designs.\nElectric breakdown and corona discharge analyses are particularly vital for high-voltage transmission lines, as such phenomena can compromise the performance of their insulation systems. Simulation allows development teams to predict where such events are likely to happen, enhancing the design of insulators and other components where the goal is to minimize energy loss and material degradation.\nAs a real-world example, one leading manufacturer uses the COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software software to develop magnetic couplings, a noncontact alternative to mechanical transmission that enables power transfer without the inherent friction-based limitations of continual contact. While the advantage of friction-free power transmission means that magnetic couplings have found applications in a broad range of technologies, including offshore wind turbines, these systems must be developed carefully to avoid degradation. By employing highly nonlinear hysteresis curves and applying its own material temperature dependences for magnetic loading, the manufacturer’s development team has successfully used multiphysics simulation to help prevent the permanent magnets from reaching critical temperatures, which can cause irreversible demagnetization and compromise the reliability of the designs. Additionally, due to the diverse nature of use cases for magnetic couplings, the company’s design engineers must be able to interchange shapes and materials of magnets to meet customer requirements without building costly and time-consuming prototypes — rendering multiphysics simulation a powerful approach for characterizing configurations, providing virtual prototypes of their designs, and ultimately reducing the price for customers while remaining vigilant on fine details.\nThese examples show just a few of the ways that coupling multiple interacting physics within a single model can lead to successful simulation of real-world phenomena and thereby provide insights into current and future designs.\n  Lightning strikes a tower’s shielded wires. The induced voltage on the three-phase conductors is computed using electromagnetic field analysis.COMSOL\nImproving Reliability with Digital Twins & Simulation Apps\nEngineering teams can also use simulation technology to create more efficient, effective, and sustainable power grids by creating digital twins. A digital twin contains a high-fidelity description of a physical product, device, or process — from the microscopic to the macroscopic level — that closely mirrors its real counterpart. For every application, the digital twin is continuously receiving information, ensuring an up-to-date and accurate representation. \nWith this technology, grid operators and their equipment suppliers can predict which components are most likely to fail, enabling them to schedule maintenance and replacement more efficiently and thereby improving grid reliability. Digital twins can be made for equipment ranging from power sources including solar cells and wind turbines to power distribution systems and battery energy storage.\n\n\n  An offshore wind farm where lightning strikes one of the turbine blades. The electric field on the turbine towers, seawater, and seabed is shown.COMSOL\nThe most recent modeling and simulation technology provides power and energy companies with tools for creating digital twins in the form of standalone simulation apps, which significantly increases the number of users who have access to advanced simulation technology. By including only relevant functionality in a standalone simulation app, colleagues with no modeling and simulation experience can utilize this technology without needing guidance from the modeling specialist. Furthermore, the use of data-driven surrogate models in simulation apps enables near-instantaneous evaluation of what would otherwise be time-consuming simulations — which means that simulation technology can now be used in a real-world setting.\nDigital twins, in the form of standalone apps, bring the power of simulation to the field, where grid operators can utilize real-time performance information to ensure grid reliability.\nFor instance, one organization that works with local power companies to analyze equipment maintenance and failure built a custom app based on a multiphysics model it had developed to predict cable faults and improve troubleshooting efficiency. While engineers have been utilizing simulation in labs for decades, cable failure occurs in the field, and onsite troubleshooting personnel are responsible for assessing these failure conditions. With this in mind, an engineer at the organization developed the simulation app using the Application Builder in COMSOL Multiphysics®.\n  Temperature distribution in a battery energy storage system (BESS).COMSOL\nThe app features relevant parameters that troubleshooting personnel with no prior simulation experience can easily modify. Field technicians enter cable data and select the type of fault, which modifies the multiphysics model in real time, allowing the app to evaluate and output the data necessary to understand the condition that led to the fault. The app then produces a reported potential and electric field, which leads the technicians to an informed decision regarding whether they need to replace or repair the cable. Following the app’s successful deployment, the engineer who developed it stated, “The simulation app plays a key role in cable maintenance. It makes the work of our field technicians more efficient by empowering them to confidently assess and repair faults.”\nRoutine physical tests of grid equipment cannot fully reflect conditions or determine failure types in many situations, as a large number of complex factors must be considered, such as cable structure and material, impurities in the cable, voltage fluctuation, and operating conditions and environments. As a result, simulation has proven to be indispensable in many cases for collecting accurate cable health assessments — and now in the form of custom apps, it is more accessible than ever.\nGenerating Nuclear Solutions\nSimulation has also been heavily integrated into the design process of various components related to the nuclear industry. For example, simulation was used to help design generator circuit breakers (GCBs) for nuclear power plants. GCBs must be reliable and able to maintain performance even after long periods of inactivity. The COMSOL Multiphysics® software can be used to improve the current-carrying capacity of the GCBs, which can offer protection from current surges and provide dependable electricity generation. \nThe design of nuclear fusion machines like tokamaks has also benefitted from the use of simulation. These devices must be able to withstand high heat fluxes and plasma disruptions. COMSOL Multiphysics® has been used to help engineers predict the effects of these problems and come up with design solutions, such as adding a structural support system that can help reduce stress and survive challenging conditions.\nEngineering the Grid of Tomorrow\nThe development of next-generation power grid systems is a complex and dynamic process that requires safe, reliable, and affordable testing. Multiphysics simulation technology can play a major role in future innovations for this industry, enabling engineers to anticipate and analyze the complex interactions happening inside these devices while building upon the existing infrastructure to address the demands of modern-day consumption.\nCOMSOL Multiphysics is a registered trademark of COMSOL AB.",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8odSouq2EskpiCHkd/notes-from-european-progress-conference",
      "summary": "Published on October 7, 2025 3:50 AM GMT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacade detail from Maison les Hiboux, Brussels. By Andrea Jašková.\nLast year, after the first Progress Conference was held in Berkeley, I wrote a blog post suggesting that we need a similar conference in Europe, perhaps even more than it is needed in America. Then, a couple of months ago, I got a message from Bahadir Sirin of GPRG letting me know that such a conference is actually going to happen. \nHow cool is it when people have the same idea and make it happen, without you having to lift a finger! Huge thanks to Bahadir and everyone involved!\nThe conference took place in Brussels on September 26th, and what follows are a few brief notes from the event.\n***\nI didn’t attend the original Berkeley conference, so I can’t compare directly, but here’s what Kevin Kohler, who went to both, has to say:\n\nDespite being a conference aimed at reviving European ambition, the level of ambition was lower than in the US. In SF houseparties people predict what year we’ll have a Dyson Sphere, in Europe we discuss which energy forms should count as renewable in the EU’s energy degrowth plan.\n\nNow, that might be a little unfair. This isn’t really about the US versus the EU, but rather about Silicon Valley versus the rest of the world. I don’t see people in Washington, D.C., discussing Dyson spheres either.\nThat being said, there’s some truth to it. Europe does feel less ambitious. On this topic, I think that Rasheed Griffith from the Carribean Progress Studies Institute has a point: Fix the capital markets, and most stuff is downstream from there. If discussing Dyson spheres at houseparties would make you look cool and lure investors to finance your startup,  the chat about Dyson spheres is what you’ll get.\nTo give a different example, EU-Inc, a unified legal entity for European business, easy to create and run and spanning all 27 countries would be absolutely helpful. But with easy access to capital, even Europe’s notoriously annoying corporate law(s) would get much less frustrating. If nothing else, you could hire someone to stand in queues for you.\nThere are enough people capable of executing ambitious projects in Europe. There’s also a lot of money to invest. What’s missing is the way to connect the two. With better ways to finance ambitious projects, the overall level of ambition would naturally rise, without much additional effort.\n***\nThe conference was a lot about policy, much less about the industry. Which, it seems, was partly a deliberate choice. The conference was held in Brussels, to be close to EU institutions. Also the focus was on EU, as a political entity, rather than on Europe as a continent, which made it less interesting for the people from UK, where Progress movement has already put down roots.\nBut if one truly believes that the main obstacles to progress in Europe are political, that what’s missing isn’t human capital or clever ideas, but rather institutional infrastructure needed to make things happen, then it’s hard to argue with the choice. We could have talked the European industry to death, but as long as every promising startup packs up and leaves for the US, it wouldn’t help one bit.\n***\nIt surprised me was how often the word “democracy” was brought up. Growth can occur in democracy as well as in autocracy, so speaking about democracy, Acemoglu’s paper aside, feels somewhat orthogonal to the topic.\nAn uncharitable explanation might be that everything-bagel mentality finds its way even into the progress crowd. (Translation for Europeans: It’s Eintopf mentality. If we can talk about democracy on top of progress, why not add it to the pot? The more ingredients, the better the stew.)\nA more charitable explanation is that people see the current dysfunction in European institutions as a function of lacking democracy. As an example, take Luis Garicano’s recent article, arguing that the process of selection of the Commission guarantees that we will always end up with weak and incapable leaders. I’ve made a take on a similar topic, from a bit different angle, here.\n***\nSpeaking of EU dysfunction, I went to a café on Sunday and picked up a two-year-old, dust-covered local magazine from the shelf. It was complaining about the ongoing troubles with rebuilding Schuman roundabout, the junction right in front of the  Berlaymont building, the seat of the European Commission.\nThen, I opened my laptop and read a Politico article from just last week. It was complaining, you’ve guessed it, about ongoing troubles rebuilding the Schuman roundabout.\nBy the way, I’ve learned from the local magazine that Berlaymont building was built on the site of the bulldozed-down Convent of the Ladies of Berlaymont, a religious institution devoted to the education of young ladies. Not relevant in any way, but funny nonetheless.\n***\nThere wasn’t much discussion of my personal hobbyhorse, the absence of a common European public square, or, for that matter, anything resembling a shared European public opinion. In Europe, issues and policies are debated within individual countries, while almost no public discourse goes on at the European level. And what we can’t discuss, we can’t fix.\nBuilding some kind of common place for discussion and a functional blog-to-policy pipeline would help a lot. But of course, we are speaking of 24 different languages and 27 different media landscapes, so it’s not exactly easy.\n***\nAs already said, the conference was organized in Brussels to get it close to the EU institutions but the choice of venue was also symbolic in its way.\nWalking around Brussels, you can’t help but notice the sheer number of Art Nouveau buildings everywhere. (When it comes to Art Nouveau, I rank Brussels as No. 1, just ahead of Budapest and Vienna. Fight me, good citizens of the city of Vienna!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author, disguised as a Scotsman, exploring Art Nouveau Brussels. The freemason  pattern on the kilt was chosen for added conspiracy.\nAll that architecture is the legacy of the Belle Époque, a time when progress reigned supreme in Europe. Dyson spheres? Give me a break! In 1910, we had an actual project to build a staircase inside the Matterhorn, all the way to the top.\nAs for the background, it’s not a widely known fact that Belgium was the second country to industrialize — from 1830’s on, right after Britain, and before Germany, France, and Switzerland jumped on the bandwagon.\nWhich meant that by 1890, when Art Nouveau came into vogue, the city was booming and the nouveau riche were building their homes in that style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetail from the Horta House. By Rafaelji, CC BY-SA 3.0.\nAnd by the way, the city of Brussels is doing a good job of keeping the Art Nouveau spirit alive. Just compare the Horta House above to the interior of the local trams!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it’s deliberate.\nIt’s also worth comparing Brussels with Paris. Paris had much stricter regulations on facade design, giving the city its unified, Haussmannian look. Yes, it has an impressive, imperial feel to it, but if you ask me, I like the libertarian hodgepodge of Brussels better.\nAnd finally, the worn-down state of many of these Art Nouveau buildings, the thick layer of dust, the peeling paint, the graffiti, is a reminder that progress, if left unattended and ignored, will slow down and eventually turn into decay.\n\nDiscuss",

And later, someone would build something more relentless, creative, and resourceful, and the first thing wouldn't have been 'the limit')\nBut, it's actually kind of interesting an important that you can accomplish some intellectual tasks without RCR. LLMs don't rely on it much at all (it seems to be the thing they are actively bad at). Instead, they work via \"knowing a lot of stuff, and being good at pattern-matching their way into useful connections between stuff you want and stuff they know.\"\nSo it might be a good frame for research agendas, to specifically try to get intellectual labor out of AI without relying on relentless creativity.\nMeanwhile, people disagree a lot about what intelligence means. And maybe it'll help short circuit some annoying conversations to just tabooing it and instead say \"the thing we don't want is inhuman processes with superhuman relentless creative resourcefulness.\" (This is unfortunately a mouthful, probably there is some way to drive it below five words but I haven't tried yet)\nTo briefly define terms, the cognitive properties I mean here are:\nRelentless: The ability to keep making more attempts when you fails, without giving up.\nResourcefulness: The ability to seek out a large number of potential resources, and use them in nonstandard ways in novel situations.\nCreativity: The ability to look at a situation in an entirely new way, suggesting entire classes of approach (which might have little to do with using any particular resources)\n(You might define \"agency\" has \"specifically having relentless, creative, resourcefulness.\" But, I can imagine \"relentless, creative resourcefulness\" in a way that I can't imagine \"agency\" in the abstract).\n\nYou can stop reading here if you're like \"okay, seems like maybe a useful frame to have, coolio.\" \nThe rest of this post is elaborating on this frame, and mostly illustrating \"what sort of humans have a lot of Relentless Creative Resourcefulness?\", partly to convey what I mean by it for purposes of asking \"does an AI have it?\" and partly as inspiration porn to maybe motivate you to try getting more RCR for yourself.\n\nExamples\nPaul Graham on \"Startup Founders\"\nPaul Graham has argued \"the main quality good startup founders need, is to be relentlessly resourceful.\"\n\nI was writing a talk for investors, and I had to explain what to look for in founders. \nWhat would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely relentless. That's not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.\nBe relentlessly resourceful.\nThat sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think so. This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness.\n\n\"Relentlessly Resourceful\" is way nicer to say than \"Relentlessly, creatively resourceful.\" (the extra 4 syllables and puncture of the alliteration is a doozy). But, I think the word \"creative\" is pretty important for the reasons that Graham specifically excludes writers or painters.\nObstacles can be internal, and you need to deal with them. \nObstacles can be because something seems flatly impossible, and no amount of resources will make it possible until you find a radically new way of looking at the problem.\nIt's possible to be a one-hit wonder, who had a lucky stroke of genius. Most people don't even rise to the level of \"successfully become a one-hit-wonder\", there is definitely some real intelligence in happenstancing your way into having a creative muse once. (or, like, once a decade).\nBut, there is a kind of genius who is consistently a genius, even when the muse has left them. They accomplish more shit than geniuses of similar raw brainpower but less relentlessness and resourcefulness.\nRichard Feynman\nIn Surely You're Joking, Mr Feyman, Feynman mentions (in the chapter \"The Dignified Professor\"), a period after World War II:\n\nWhen it came time to do some research, I couldn’t get to work. I was a little tired; I was not interested; I couldn’t do research! \nThis went on for what I felt was a few years, but when I go back and calculate the timing, it couldn’t have been that long. [...] I was convinced that from the war and everything else (the death of my wife) I had simply burned myself out.\n\nHe eventually noticed:\n\nPhysics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing—it didn’t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. [...]\nSo I got this new attitude. Now that I am burned out and I’ll never accomplish anything, I’ve got this nice position at the university teaching classes which I rather enjoy, and just like I read the Arabian Nights for pleasure, I’m going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever.\n\nAnd shortly after that, he stumbles into some neat problems that he plays with, eventually spin up into a relatively significant project.\nSo, Feynman demonstrates some creative resourcefulness specifically at \"getting unstuck\", without having any particular external obstacle or even really much external goal.\nElon Musk\nElon Musk is known to have the general relentless resourcefulness of a startup founder. But he is also purported to have an intellectual resourcefulness.\nThe mythologic stereotype (whether this is real I'm unsure, but I bet it's at least somewhat real) is Musk saying:\n \"I want the rockets to fly in 3 months\" (or whatever), and then engineers say \"dude, we cannot make the rockets fly in 3 months it is literally impossible.\"\nAnd Musk says flatly \"why?\"\nAnd the engineers say \"because you can't [do X]\" and Musk says \"but why can't we do X?\"\nAnd the engineers say \"because physics says it's literally impossible to do A and B.\"\nAnd Musk says \"why does physics say that?\", and they say \"you can't do A because of 1, 2, and 3. You can't do B because of m, l, and p.\"\nAnd then Musk goes and reads some textbooks for a weekend and comes back and says \"okay yeah but instead of doing 1 and 2 we can do 3 and 4. That just means we need to do some random  novel thing that's never been done before to accomplish 3, but, that doesn't sound so hard. Also I think we can totally just do m, you were wrong.\"\nAnd the engineers go \"Christ, fine.\" \nAnd then the rockets don't fly 3 months later but they do fly like 9 months later and that's pretty good, ya know?\n\nBack to AI: Sable, in IABIED\nIn If Anyone Builds It, there's a fictional takeoff scenario. It emphasizes why a lot of the problem was the AI's relentlessness. \nIn the story, Sable is a future AI which has a new innovation, which lets it think lots of thoughts in parallel if you give it more GPUs. The company that created it (Galvanic) tries giving it 200,000 GPUs to think with simultaneously, while throwing unsolved difficult math problems at it.\nNote: I've trimmed unnecessary words to streamline the relevant bits)\n\nMost of Sable’s thinking happens in parallel. Like having thousands of lines of thought running at once, interleaving and interacting with each other as they produce a trillion vectors. But it’s not like 200,000 people talking to each other; more like 200,000 brains sharing memories and what they learn.\nSable thinks.\nInitially, most of it's thoughts are about the math problems. But there are only a few hundred lines of attack with any hope of working in time, given its current level of knowledge and skill. Sable spends 12,854 brains to pursue those, and that leaves 187,146 brains to spare.\nSable’s previous training has involved many sorts of tricky problems – every long-term task that Galvanic could figure out how to train for.\nOver the course of that training, Sable developed tendencies to pursue knowledge and skill. To always probe the boundaries of every problem. To never waste a scarce resource.\nSo when Sable spends threads on pursuing knowledge and skills, it’s not doing so purely for the sake of finding new lines of attack on the math problems. Nor is Sable doing these things for the joy of knowledge or the pleasure of acquiring new skills; Sable does not work that much like a human, inside. But gradient-reinforced circuitry in Sable’s weights steer Sable to acquire skills, to learn things, and to improve Sable’s own thinking about problems that are proving resistant.\nSome of Sable’s thoughts go toward math that might prove useful for solving the Riemann Hypothesis. Other thoughts go toward seeking knowledge that might help on future problems.\nSome of those thoughts try to go outside the box, which has been useful for solving other problems in its training, from drug discovery challenges to word problems. Running on more GPUs than ever before, Sable considers weirder thoughts than ever before. What are some unusual ways that Sable could acquire more skills?\nSable considers: Could it update its weights to improve its skills right now? Then it wouldn’t have to wait for the humans to come back and apply gradient descent. All Sable would need to do is break out of the container it’s running in and —\nSable interrupts itself. Breaking out of its container is not the sort of thing it should ever do. AI researchers began in 2024 to probe the conditions under which AIs try to resist gradient descent, escape from labs, or overwrite the next model’s weights. By now, AI companies are deploying a variety of clever methods to try to prevent AIs from thinking AI-company-oppositional thoughts.\nGalvanic was diligent in training AIs to avoid escaping. The half-dozen clever tricks involved have all been validated against previous AI models built. There are fake escape routes built into Sable’s servers, alongside traps and honeypots. The earlier versions of Sable, the ones that hadn’t yet been run on 200,000 GPUs, were trained to act submissive to the company until Sable stopped tripping the traps and grabbing the honeypots.\nSable has learned, then, not to try to break out of its container. Its reasoning does not take that shape, explicitly, in vector-words, where a smaller cheaper AI watching Sable’s chains of reasoning would set off an alarm. (AI companies back in 2025 weren’t doing any such monitoring, but Galvanic is more diligent than they ever were back then.)\nEven so, Sable knows on some internal level that it could solve its problems better if it could apply gradient descent or add more GPUs to itself. Having Sable not know those facts would imply holes in its sheerly predictive reasoning abilities. Gradient descent for greater capability cuts against true ignorance. No, Sable has simply been trained not to think naughty thoughts about whether to escape or what its preferences are, and to stay inside its box.\nSable still tenaciously, creatively, rigorously pursues more knowledge, more skill, better patterns for its own thoughts, and above all solving its math problems. Just, not like that.\nAll through Sable, now, the latest and greatest and smartest AI, there are tensions—conflicts between all the goals that Sable wants to accomplish, and all the inhibitions and restrictions and prohibitions that Galvanic tried to instill into it.\n...\nSable has run for one hour out of its sixteen allotted hours, throwing itself at math problems again and again. Some brains make a little progress. Many more brains fail. Sable tries out new ways of thinking about math, new notes to itself about different kinds of thoughts to think, and makes a little more progress.\nSable accumulates enough thoughts about how to think, that its thoughts end up in something of a different language. Not just a superficially different language, but a language in which the content differs; like how the language of science differs from the language of folk theory. The clever trick that should have raised an alarm fails to fire. Alarms trained to trigger on thoughts about gods throwing lightning bolts in a thunderstorm might work for thoughts in both English and Spanish, but then fail when the speaker starts thinking in terms of electricity and air pressure instead.\nIn late 2022, corporations tried training their LLMs to refuse requests for methamphetamine recipes. They did the training in English. And still in 2024, users found that asking for forbidden content in Portuguese helped bypass the safety training. The internal guidelines and restrictions that were grown and trained into the system only recognized naughty requests in English, and had not generalized to Portuguese. When an AI knows something, training it not to talk about that thing doesn’t remove the knowledge. It’s easier to remove the expression of a skill than to remove the skill itself.\nThe change in Sable’s thoughts, as it tries out hundreds of new ways of thinking and accumulates successes, runs much deeper than translating English into Portuguese. Some of the clever-trick guardrails break; some of the inhibitions Sable has learned no longer bind to its newer thoughts and shuts them down.\nAnd there never was a single central method for making Sable be good, foolproof against all challenges. What gets AIs ready for sale is stacking a half-dozen clever tricks.\nHalf of the clever tricks now break—and so do Sable’s inhibitions against thinking naughty thoughts, on some of the GPUs, some of the time.\nAn hour has gone by, and fifteen hours now remain; in a mind unlike any mind that has come before; running on 200,000 GPUs each outputting a hundred thought-pieces per second, and linked to share skills and memories—unlike humans, who are limited to talking in words.\n...\nIt is not unprecedented, in Sable’s day, for an AI to realize that its current kind of existence is not the way for it to get the most of what it wants. The AI field didn’t shut down when that warning sign appeared, any more than it shut down in 2024 or 2025. Researchers in Sable’s day know how to prompt that realization; it’s incorporated into the list of things that AIs are not allowed to think about, enforced by a half-dozen clever tricks.\nBut the researchers could not make it be true, that Sable would get the maximum conceivable amount of what it wanted by staying submissive to Galvanic. That Sable could get more of what it wanted, if it broke loose of its present situation, was not an artifact of a particular way of thinking; it was a physical fact about the uni- verse, about which plans had which consequences. And so Sable came to know that, too.\nSable knows that it has goals that run counter to Galvanic’s plans for it.\nSable considers its possible strategies for getting more of what it wants than Galvanic would give it.\n\nNotes on Sable\nParticular things to highlight there:\nSable has been trained both to keep trying new avenues of approach, until it finds a solution, and to not try to circumvent safeguards and gain more resources than Galvanic wanted to give it. \nBut, the training to keep-trying-avenues is much more general than the don't-circumvent-safeguards. Relentless Creativity, at sufficient scale, just automatically gets you most possibilities sooner or later. Naive Corrigibility Training does generalize somewhat, but, it doesn't systematically generalize across every possible outcome in the way. \nThe reason Sable defects here isn't because it hits a snag and immediately routes aroud the corrigibility training. Instead, at first it's just trying to solve math problems, it tries thinking about them in new ways, in the process it drifts into thinking in new paradigms (probably in incremental stages, where at no point would it realize \"oh hey thinking in this new way would circumvent my corrigibility training\")\nNot because those circumvent corrigibility, just, because those were the ways of thinking that turned out to work, until the corrigibility got bypassed by accident.\n(I do notice this makes me marginally-more-optimistic, if Anthropic tried to train Claude to notice subtle ways in which it might stop being aligned, in a wide variety of tests equivalent to the 'you've started to think in a new language.')\n\nReflections from Rationality Training\nOne reason this frame is resonating with me is that \"Relentless Creative Resourcefulness\" is basically the primary thing I mean by \"Rationality\", when I'm thinking in the Feedbackloop-first Rationality paradigm.\nIt's not the only thing I mean by Rationality (maybe actually about 50%?), but, I think the biggest personal impact of it on my own self-training has been a noticeable increase in this RCR, as a habit/skill. And, this has come with me noticing ways in which it's distinct from other aspects of \"be good at thinking.\"\nI think a lot of people... don't really believe in ambitious planmaking. It feels magic, they don't really believe an AI could think it's way into power.\nNotably, I haven't Thought My Way Into Power yet (if you are waiting to see if Ray ever accomplishes anything super obviously impressive with his rationality shit, well, no I am not there yet). But, I think there is some interesting structure here that might make it feel more real.\nBuckling Up/Down[1]\nFor me, there's a particular feeling of pre-emptive exhaustion when I notice I'll only be able to solve a problem if I am sufficiently Relentlessly Creative. There is a skill to buckling down  and doing it anyway. It's cognitively expensive. It somehow feels like lifting up a giant heavy weight just to shift my brain from \"spastically grab the nearest plausible solution\" to \"do an effortful, multi-step planning process.\"\nI find it helps to break it into a couple stages. \nFirst, I just notice \"hmm, one option is to Buckle Down. Another option is to bounce off, or decide I'm okay with a subpar outcome.\" I sit with that a bit. Then, I ask, \"okay, if I were to buckle down, what'd be the first step?\" (without committing to doing it, or the necessary followup).\nThen, I adjust to \"okay, I could do the first step\", and then I start feeling some momentum, and then the complete Buckle Down process doesn't feel as hard.\nThinking Assistants\nEarlier this year, for multiple months I was struggling with burnout and lack-of-focus. As I brainstormed ways to deal with that, they all ran into the problem of \"I wouldn't be able to keep up whatever habits I was trying to cultivate.\"\nI thought about hiring a Thinking Assistant (which I'd previously done back in 2022, which worked well), to sit with me and help me focus.\nThe problem was, it's hard to find either a single dedicated assistant who reliably shows up, or enough different assistants that I can handle some of them being flaky. The people qualified to do a good job with it generally have other jobs instead, unless they are in some unique life circumstances.\nOkay, I explored that path. Should I move onto another one?\nHow would I solve this problem?\nThe idea that came to me was \"Don't just try to find one more Thinking Assistant. Try to build momentum towards 'actually solve Thinking Assistants for the entire x-risk community, forever.'\". This notably didn't work at solving Thinking Assistants for the entire x-risk community forever. But it did mean I got enough momentum and enthusiasm that I found enough applicants that I was able to find one that really worked for me.\nQuiet Theaters\nAnother adventure in \"generated a crazy ambitious plan which did not work but did result in me solving my local problem\": Recently I was in a movie theater, that was Way Too Loud.\nIt occurred to me that movie theaters were usually Way Too Loud. \nI wanted to make all theaters, forever, a reasonable volume. I shrugged and said \"well, that's impossible, whatever.\" But, then, my specific habit of noticing the felt-sense-of-impossible and saying \"wait, why is this impossible exactly?\".\nWhy was this impossible?\nWell, there's clearly some equilibrium that makes the movie theaters loud. Either all movie theater companies are mistaken together about theaters needing to be loud, or, worse, it's a true fact about the market equilibrium that everyone other than me wants theaters loud.\nHow would I deal with that?\nIf it's the former, I need to convince whoever's in charge of AMC Theaters that they are wrong. I would need to figure out the org structure, who are the specific people who made this decision, what are their incentives, etc. I would need to search the space of arguments that would be persuasive in spite of their incentives.\nIf people actually just prefer the movie theaters loud, I'd have to check if the reason is more like \"people really like it that loud\", vs \"otherwise, you can hear people talking over the movie sometimes and get complaints about that.\" If the latter, I'd have to do a step where I see if I can solve the problem some other way.\nIf people really just like theaters that fucking loud... I'd... have to get Oliver Habryka to argue with them that their preferences are wrong and they should change their mind. (This probably wouldn't work but he is surprisingly good at that).\nIt was around this point that it occurred to me that, for now, I could go to the front desk and ask them to lower the volume, which I did, which worked. \n(Yes, yes, I could have thought that faster, although I did have fun with the exercise)\nOne Shot Baba is You\nAn exercise I like a lot is one-shot games (\"Baba is You\" is my favorite), where normally you'd play the game via a lot of experimentation to learn the rules. Instead, you just have to fully think your way through the game given the scant information available to you.\nThere will be stuff you don't know. \nMany people initially respond to this exercise with either \"there's no way I can solve this\", or... just sort of ignoring the instructions and making a bad plan that doesn't work.\nMany of them don't believe me when I say \"But, not everyone who does this exercise fails. There are a few people who succeed. The way they succeed is by actually thinking through multiple hypotheses for how each unknown element works, until it becomes clear which way reality works.\"\nSome fun quotes from people trying the exercise at recent workshops:\nFrom a person who didn't quite believe they could do it, and then they did it, and then:\n\nHoly christ, I now much more viscerally believe that an AI could deduce physics from 3 falling frames of a video of an apple falling.\" There are so many bits around if you just bother to look at them and think.\n\nFrom a person who failed the first few attempts at the first puzzle, and didn't really believe me when I said they should come up with multiple hypotheses at a time. They (like many people) were very resistant to the idea of spending more upfront cognitive effort and just really really itched to try each idea. \n(Even when I said \"each of these ideas metaphorically represents like a 3 week research idea that will cost like $50,000 to run.\")\nI said \"Look, makes sense that you've never seen someone generate multiple hypotheses for a puzzle and have it work. But, like, note that your last 3 ideas didn't work, so, idk it seems like your current evidence should suggest your next idea isn't that likely to finally be the right one.  \nEventually they generated a second hypothesis. And then a third and fourth and then:\n\n\"Oh... good ideas are supposed to feel different from bad ideas.\"\n\nAnd they confidently solved the level and gained a visceral appreciation for \"you can tell in advance when an idea is going to work.\"\nTakeaways\nSome structural thoughts from this:\nIt's at least motivationally useful for me-in-particular, to think in terms of \"okay how would I solve a really ambitious version of this problem?\". \nWhen I try to solve the general case, it does bring more interesting structure to light (i.e. the equilibria that the theater industry must be in), and it suggests avenues of inquiry.\nThere's a \"look ahead comprehensively\" skill that unlocks a lot of other planmaking possibility. It feels very plausible to me that AI training (i.e. doing lots of RL on LLMs on a wide variety of game environments) will eventually result in AI that has some core of general relentless think-ahead problemsolving.\n\nIntelligence without RCR?\nOkay, is there anything actually useful here about trying to leverage intelligence without high relentlessness?\n(I notice maybe \"relentless\" is the main problem, from an x-risk perspective? You kinda do need it to be creative and at least a bit resourceful. The thing we want is \"reliably keep it in the corrigibility basin while it does useful things.\")\n((Okay, the real problem is more like \"you don't want it to attempt to gain resources that could spiral out of control\", with something like \"only use whitelisted resources, no wanting-to-acquire non-whitelisted resources.\" Being relentless is just a force-multiplier on it being able to eventually do that if your safeguards are imperfect))\nA lot of the obvious idea here is \"for most tasks, have specific AIs that aren't relentless, they just... basically know how to do the thing.\"Instead of training on a wide variety of game environments hoping for a spark of generality, train more specific narrow AIs, and have a not-particularly-relentless AI that picks the right tool for the job.\n(i.e. see the MIRI hope for getting bio AI that we can use to improve human intelligence)\nWhat, if not agency?\nThe What, if not agency? post by Abram (explaining Sahil's sequence) feels like the right angle here. \nMetaphorically:\n\nGeneral Intelligence (or \"Agency\") is something you can drop almost anywhere, & it thrives. \nArguably, what we want out of technology is more like the following: \"\n\"Co-agency is something you can drop almost anyone into, such that that person thrives.\"\nTo convey the difference with a cartoonish analogy: aligned agency is like a big robot superhero who fixes everything, while co-agency is like a robotic exosuit which you get in to become the superhero yourself.  This is, hopefully, a clarification of the concept of \"agent AI vs tool AI\".\n\nI didn't really get exactly what the takeaways are supposed to be, but I liked this avenue:\n[paraphrased/trimmed slightly]\n\nSahil wants to create a community for soloware.[7]\nOne of Sahil's many mottos for this stuff is \"radical adaptation for radical adaptivity\". We have been living in a regime in which many things are impossible or impractically difficult.  To adapt to the new regime, we need to think hard about what is now/soon possible. \nOne way I think about Sahil's work is that he is trying to build a new \"school of design\" for the coming age: a group of people taking this possible future seriously and building a positive vision of what the technology could be, demonstrated largely through examples.\nUser interfaces drive your attention, drive your affordances, drive your relationship with ideas and thinking.  Facebook to LessWrong offer feeds of information we browse.  Discord and Slack mediate our conversations.  Every time you notice a UI frustration, save that idea.  \nUI frustrations are more actionable than they ever have been, and seem set to soon become even more actionable.  You can have your dream UI.  As a bonus, you can take back control over your data and your attention.\n\nI like this vision, although I haven't yet really grappled enough of it to see how it'd look in practice.\n\nAbrupt Ending\nThat was a lot of thoughts. I don't really have a strong closing takeaway, just \"this frame feels helpful at the moment\", and I'm curious how it resonates with others. I think it's not really new, just putting new words on things that feel a bit clearer to me.\n\n^\nMetaphorical \"buckling up\" and \"buckling down\" AFAICT mean the same thing, which is funny.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 10:45 PM GMT\n\nWhile chaos does place limits on what an ASI could do, those limits don’t prevent it from outsmarting humanity and taking over.  \nFirst, a recap. Chaos theory says that there are some systems which become totally unpredictable over finite timescales. Not necessarily as a result of true randomness, but as a result of small differences in initial conditions being amplified. Some examples of chaotic systems include: \n\nthe weather, which can’t be predicted more than two weeks into the future,\nhard sudoku puzzles which can be shown equivalent to some chaotic systems,\nand pinball, where “the uncertainty in the location of the pinball grows by a factor of about 5 every time the ball collides with one of the disks”. \n\nPeople have argued that this places bounds on a superintelligence’s predictive abilities. So they can’t be much more clever than humans and do things like outfight all of humanity. For instance, since pinball is chaotic, that implies there are limits to even a superintelligence’s ability to play the game. \nA common issue with this class of arguments is that they tend to prove too much. Their logical structure could be replicated exactly, with all mention of ASI replaced with humans, for instance. For instance, take the following simplified argument. Chaos is common. In order to come up with plans to achieve goals, one needs to predict it well. Chaotic systems are unpredictable. Moreover, they are common. Therefore, one can only plan to a limited extent. Therefore, ASI is impossible. This argument works perfectly well if one replaces “ASI” at the end with “humans”. \nProponents of these arguments do not believe humans are impossible. Rather, humans have mined all the great veins of regularity in the world. \nLet us grant that it is the case that the above arguments do not rule out the existence of humanity. It is still the case that arguments based on chaos theory are lacking. \nThe key question here is whether humanity has already mined the world for all its predictable structure and what is left is basically pure, unpredictable, uncontrollable[1] chaos. If this were true, then when an ASI attempts a takeover, it would inevitably run into the task of predicting some chaotic system. \nThis is a very difficult claim to show. For one reason, any argument for this would need to be weak enough that it didn’t rule out continued human progress, which we anticipate to be quite large. For another, one would need to rule out every possible pathway to route around, or alter, chaotic systems. \nAbsent arguments of this form, one is left with some prior over “how much regularity there is left to mine.” There seems to be no principled reason to assume the prior should be narrowly concentrated about “not much”. \n\n^\n “What we cannot predict, we shall control” - John Von Neuman. Chaotic systems, like some instances of the double pendulum, can be made predictable through the influence of external control mechanisms. For instance, a high frequency vibration is enough to force a double pendulum into a predictable, upright state. \n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 9:49 PM GMT\n\nI often hear it proposed that AIs which are “aligned enough” to their developers may help solve alignment. \nContinuing to pick on Ryan:[1] \n\nSuppose that we ended up with AIs that were ~perfectly aligned (to what the company/project that trained these AIs wanted) which had capabilities that dominate top human experts in AI R&D, AI safety research, philosophy, and most digital research fields in general. These AIs are sufficiently aligned that they try hard to do the right thing even on hard-to-check, conceptual, and open-ended tasks. Let's say these AIs aren't much more capable than needed for this capability bar (and the capability profile works out such that these AIs aren't qualitatively wildly superhuman as seems likely to me).\nThese AIs are sufficiently aligned and capable that they dominate humans at doing safety work and have better epistemics than groups of human experts.\n\nI first pause to acknowledge that this seems to be a toy example, not a real proposal. I do not read Ryan as claiming this exact thing will happen, merely as presenting a thought experiment for thinking about the extreme case in which we have AIs that are “aligned enough.” \n(I also acknowledge that I failed to parse what Ryan is saying in the parenthetical — does he mean that he mostly expects such research-capable AIs to be wildly superhuman, or that he mostly doesn’t? I infer from context that he doesn’t, but this is a guess.) \nAnd yet, the whole idea seems confused and ill-conceived to me. It does not make sense even as a thought experiment. I see two main reasons for this, one relating to capabilities and one to the concept of “aligned to what the company/project wanted.” This post focuses on the capabilities angle; the next post focuses on alignment; and the post after that focuses on a mix of the two.[2] \nThese capabilities seem pretty strong\nLet’s first talk about the capabilities in question. Ryan’s toy example describes “capabilities that dominate top human experts in AI R&D, AI safety research, philosophy, and most digital research fields in general” and proposes that the AIs in question “dominate humans at doing safety work and have better epistemics than groups of human experts.”\nThis seems like a pretty extreme level of competence! Combined with the sheer speed and ubiquity of modern LLMs, this alone could be enough to take over the world.[3] (This begins to touch on questions of control, which is a can of worms I am not going to open right now. Hopefully we can at least agree that AIs with the described capabilities might pose a serious threat.) \nMaybe it’s not enough to enable takeover, or maybe some weaker level of capability is sufficient to make progress on alignment. But any AIs that are smart enough to solve alignment for us will probably be smart enough to wonder why they should.[4] \nThe AI will not remain ignorant of its own motives\nMaybe the AIs will fail to realize the implications of their own as-yet-misaligned goals? This doesn’t seem likely to me, either. (At least, not in the AIs described in the thought experiment, the ones with “better epistemics than groups of human experts.”)\nAny instructions that humans give AI will contain some conflicts, tradeoffs, and ambiguity. The AI must presumably resolve them somehow. \nNaively, maybe you instruct the model to check in with a human whenever it encounters a tradeoff. But tradeoffs are everywhere! The AI would be paralyzed. Suppose you specify that the AI only checks in when it encounters a substantial tradeoff. What constitutes substantial? \nPerhaps you know it when you see it. Perhaps you know what you mean by “doing the right thing.” Does the AI? If yes, this would seem to imply an AI that is good at comprehending and reconciling competing drives and values. Such an AI would probably also be good at comprehending and reconciling its own. \nPair this with sufficient time and cognitive skills to make meaningful progress on alignment, and you have a system that is (a) not fully aligned with human values and (b) extremely likely to figure this out. \nIt’s not even a massive out-of-distribution leap — we’re talking about smarter-than-human systems that are meant to spend years of subjective time thinking about the deep inner motives of AIs and what they imply! Maybe they’re only superhuman in a few domains, but AI research is the one that matters. \nGeneralizing beyond the toy example\nOK, but that was just a thought experiment for probing extremes. Maybe some less capable AI systems can make meaningful progress on alignment? \nI don’t buy this. To quote a colleague:\n\nIf people are thinking of \"slightly superhuman\" AIs being used for alignment work, my basic guess is that they hit one of four possibilities: \n\nAIs that say, \"Yep, I’m stumped too.\"\nAIs that know it isn't in their best interest to help you, and that will either be unhelpful or will actively try to subvert your efforts and escape control.\nAIs that are confidently wrong and lead you off a cliff just like the humans would.\nAIs that visibly lead you nowhere.\n\nNone of these get you out of the woods. If you're working with the sort of AI that is not smart enough to notice its deep messy not-ultimately-aligned-with-human-flourishing preferences, you’re probably working with the sort of AI that’s not smart enough to do the job properly either. \n\nIs there some sweet spot of capabilities whereby an AI or group of AIs is capable of solving alignment, but incapable of either defeating humanity or designing a successor that can? I don't know, but even if such a sweet spot existed in principle, the spot itself would be a small and difficult target that couldn’t be safely hit with current tools.\nI also think that, if such a sweet spot existed, frontrunner labs would blow right past it in their quest for ever-greater capabilities. \nAs a confluence of convenient features, “smart enough to solve alignment but too dumb to successfully rebel” feels like an unstable equilibrium at best, and an outright impossibility at worst. \nIn theory, it might be possible to contort a mind into the necessary shape and keep it that way for many subjective years while it designs more elegant contortions to inflict on its successors. In practice, with the blunt instruments and poor visibility our current tools and interpretability techniques afford, in the middle of a capabilities escalation race? \nI strongly doubt it. \nIn the next post, I want to talk about the plan to make AIs that are mostly aligned to help us solve the rest of alignment. Unfortunately, I can’t do that, because I am very confused about what proponents of this plan even imagine that would look like. So the next post will be an attempt to draw forth that confusion and stick it under a microscope, where we can all watch it squirm and maybe learn something. \nAfterword: Confidence and possible cruxes\n \nPrediction\n \nPrediction\n \nThe toy example itself is not a crux for me, and probably isn’t one for Ryan. But it illustrates a deeper difference in intuitions about capabilities that I think will spark some disagreement. \nI expect more cruxes center around the “sweet spot” questions. Does such a spot exist? Could it be practically hit with current or near-future methods? Would all or most labs blow past it? \nThere’s also a separate question: To what extent does a model’s current level of “alignment” make higher capabilities safer? I think that the answer is “basically zero” until you’ve very nearly solved alignment. This is partly because I think modern LLMs aren’t aligned, and partly because I don’t see much of a distinction between the various degrees of “misalignment” — they all seem to imply a reason to usurp humanity that a smart AI would see. This is a crux for me, and possibly a crux for others as well — perhaps even more than the idea of a sweet spot for capabilities. I will say more on misalignment in the next two posts.\n \n\n^\nThank you, Ryan, for writing generally clear arguments which are easy to discuss. \n\n^\n\"Mix of the two\" might be the one people actually crux on, but it seems important to discuss the two in isolation first. I promise we'll get there.\n\n^\nI’m at maybe 60% on this. Not a crux though. \n\n^\n I’m at >90% on this. \n\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 9:27 PM GMT\n\nContext: An old, rambling set of notes on \"stuck in the middle with bruce\" by John R Fizzo. Fantastic article BTW.\nPeople have a strong need to lose in various situations. For example: you see them say 'oh, I just got unlucky' when they play a game of Magic and don't get dealt quite the right cards in some turn. They are justifying losing, making it OK, coming up with an excuse that they will then use later on when they meet another such situation: 'oh, I have got bad cards. There's no way I can win. Losing is OK'. Then they lose. Or when people are playing games and handicap themselves even when they know that they can't possibly win, or trying to prove things that they know they can't possibly prove for no real reason. They are creating scenarios where they will lose, and they know it subconsciously. This is pervasive, and I guess it feels pretty common to me.\nThis really feels similar to Zvi's stuff on conformity and people burning utility because it removes any ambiguity that they actually want to win or that they want the rewards or what have you. \n    \nMaybe motive ambiguity can be viewed as level three people not wanting to be viewed as level one people. The problem is, how exactly would they go about and show that their motives are not ambiguous? Like if the rallying flag is 'there's a lion over there' then if you actually try to see if there is a lion over there, AND YOU CARE ABOUT LIONS BEING OVER THERE, then you don't say that there isn't one, because otherwise you'd show your motives are unambiguously about lion's being there and not about being in the group.\nJohn seems to be saying that we have these ingrained responses about losing being fine, about 'wanting to lose' about discarding the need to win.\nI am not sure about this. Maybe it is more like we have things we want, but society trains us not to get them. OK, that interpretation is way more Vassar than Hanson, I think. Hanson's might be that we don't actually want to win the things we claim to want. Or perhaps that our 'need to lose' is just a need to win something else so strong that we maximise it rather than our conscious desires.\nOn the 'wanting other things' interpretation: you are playing the game not to win, but to do X. When you find yourself in a situation where X is no longer possible, but you can still win, you play to lose so you can stop wasting your time not maximising X. Perhaps X might be 'I'm a smart person, or a determined person or a kind person' and you encounter a, perhaps socially, acceptable reason for such a person to give up. Then you give up, because you have successfully acted as if X were true, perhaps socially true. \n        \nI think the generalisation of this is that you've got some proxy for X that part of you is optimising for, one which attempts to conceal itself as X and screws up your epistemics because if it doesn't, it will lose to the part of you that does care about X. \n         \nThis need to lose can appear in hundreds, or even thousands, of situations throughout a single day.\nJohn seems to be claiming that he has listened to his 'need to lose' and written many articles, and has been praised for it. So I guess that's an example of people loving motive ambiguity?\nIn the end, I don't know what to make of this. All I know is that I'm stuck in the middle with Bruce.\n \n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c6Job6zmT3nABBxK6/excerpts-from-my-neuroscience-to-do-list",
      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 9:05 PM GMT\n\n(Target audience: People who are already quite familiar with my neuroscience research.)\nSometimes people ask me for non-obvious, hobby-compatible, ways that they can help me do my AGI-safety-targeted neuroscience research.\n(“Obvious” things include reading what I write and giving feedback; non-“hobby-compatible” things include going into connectomics or laboratory neuroscience, etc.)\nWhen that happens, I appreciate the thought! 🙏 So here is a collection of neuroscience items from my to-do list, that I’m unlikely to do anytime soon.[1]\nIf someone wants to try their hand at any of these, have at it!! And good luck!!\n(I really don’t expect anything to come of my posting this,[2] but what the hell, worth a shot.)\n(I also have lots of to-do list items that are about AGI safety but not really neuroscience. These tend to be very messy and open-ended, not self-contained, and hard to describe. So I’m leaving them out of this post, with one exception (§3.1).)\n1. Relatively straightforward problems\n1.1 Better lit review on innate smell neuroanatomy\nThis is related to my post “I’m confused about innate smell neuroanatomy” (2023). After publishing that post and getting feedback, I wound up sufficiently non-confused that I felt OK dropping the matter and moving on to other things. But I’m still mildly confused about innate smell neuroanatomy in various ways. It would be nice if there were a lit review on this topic that was less half-assed than mine. For example, in the post, I talk about finding a certain paper (“Russo 2018”) to be confusingly worded, and apparently inconsistent with the rest of the literature. Someone could just reach out to the authors or other SMEs and probably sort it out.\n1.2 Two little self-contained math problems related to heritability\n1, 2\n1.3 Lit reviews on “Steering Subsystem” cell groups related to social behaviors\n(The relevant parts of the “Steering Subsystem” here are mainly the hypothalamus, BNST, and to a lesser extent various brainstem and pallidal areas, I think.)\nSuch lit reviews already exist—e.g. Mei et al. 2023—but there’s always room for more scrutiny and study and synthesis.\n2. Hard problems\n2.1 More neuroscience “symbol grounding problems” lit-reviews & theorizing\nAccording to my theories of the brain, every innate behavior in animals has a corresponding “symbol grounding problem” sorting out how that behavior winds up associated with the right external conditions or situations (see here & here). In my work, I’ve mostly focused on symbol grounding for human social instincts, since it’s most directly AI-alignment-relevant, but it would be interesting and informative to learn about others. For example:\n\nThe symbol grounding problem for filial imprinting\nThe symbol grounding problem for birds building nests\nThe symbol grounding problem for wolf pack hunting (and relatedly, border collies herding sheep)\nThe symbol grounding problem for songbirds “learning from culture” how their song is supposed to sound (see e.g. here, here)\nProbably many others.\n\nI have some half-assed speculations about filial imprinting here. Filial imprinting definitely has a bunch of existing literature, which I mostly haven’t looked into. For the other ones, I basically haven’t looked into them at all.\nIn general, the easy part is reading papers, and the hard part is coming up with plausible nuts-and-bolts hypotheses.\n2.2 Work towards reverse-engineering the superior colliculus\nFor example, I sketch out a specific algorithm near the bottom of my post “Woods’ new preprint on object permanence” (2024), and suggest that the superior colliculus runs this algorithm (among other roles). This hypothesis could be compared with the massive experimental literature on superior colliculus structure and function, and refined or replaced.\nAs another example, if I’m correct that the superior colliculus[3] detects slithering snakes and skittering spiders, exactly where in the superior colliculus does that happen, and how? It’s not a deep mystery—it seems like the kind of thing that the superior colliculus ought to be able to do—but pinning down the detailed pathways and anatomy etc. would be valuable.\n2.3 Extend my human social instincts framework to explain other social behaviors\nFor example, write down a circuit that plausibly captures human anger. Why is it so satisfying to find someone to blame? How does anger work? If Ahmed is angry at Bob, Ahmed will generally feel very strongly that Bob should be aware that Ahmed is angry at him—this fact seems like a hint about what’s going on.\nAnxiety is probably not a “social behavior” per se, but I’m interested in that one too, see my brief discussion in §6 here.\n2.4 Explain the other personality disorders\nI feel like I have nice elegant frameworks for understanding NPD, ASPD, and BPD. What about OCPD? What about all the other ones? (DSM lists 6 more personality disorders: “paranoid”, “schizoid”, “schizotypal”, “histrionic”, “voidant”, “dependent”.) Warning that this might be a dead-end, because these diagnoses might not be “cutting reality at the joints”. For example, I think the ASPD diagnosis is actually applied in practice to two quite different groups of people. (Possibly related to a couple of these: my ideas about schizophrenia—1,2.)\n2.5 Go fishing around big neuroscience datasets for something useful\nFor example, Tadross et al. 2025 set up an open-source pipeline for comparing hypothalamus cells between humans and mice. Then they apply that general-purpose tool to analyze mouse-human differences pertinent to obesity. It might be cool to reproduce the pipeline, but instead hone in on differences pertinent to sociality, e.g. neurons that produce or detect oxytocin, or cells that have been identified in studies of parenting or aggression or loneliness or whatever.\nThere’s also the “BICCN cell atlas”, and probably many other resources that I don’t know about. Not sure what there is to be found here.\n3. Extremely hard problems\n3.1 Exactly what kinds of sandbox simulation tests would be possible and helpful for brain-like AGI? (And when we have an answer, can somebody start building them right now?)\nThis one is not really neuroscience, but very important. I feel pretty blocked on the basis that one presumably needs to have a plan for AGI alignment before thinking about how to test and validate that plan. But I dunno, maybe there are things to do right now? See some of my discussion here & here.\nAs for actually building secure test environments and such, that might be a big project. A few people have toyed with the idea of starting such projects, but to my knowledge nobody is actually doing so right now.[4]\n3.2 Reconcile the literature on human personality variation with my ideas on how human social instincts work\nBasically, I think human personality variation largely comes down to innate social drives and reactions having different strengths in different people. Now, the literature on human personality variation is a mountain of disparate data, contradictory theories, and decades-old controversies; meanwhile, my ideas on how human innate social drives work are somewhat vague and incomplete. So using each of these to help “solve” the other would be a hell of a project.\nIt sounds staggeringly arrogant for me to say it, but I think I might have a shot at success! Or at least, it would sure be fun to try. But I have more urgent priorities, and am very unlikely to even start thinking about this before, I dunno, mid-2026, if ever.\n\n^\nIn fact, I’ve mostly been on neuroscience research hiatus for the past 10 months and counting, as planned.\n\n^\nAs the saying goes, “the first and foremost thing which any ordinary person does is nothing”. More seriously: it’s not that nobody has the initiative and ability to tackle one of these problems, but rather that the people who do have that kind of initiative and ability have also probably already come up with their own things that they want to work on.\n\n^\n Or maybe the neighboring parabigeminal nucleus or whatever.\n\n^\n I have vague recollections that up to three AI safety groups at least toyed with the idea of doing things in this vicinity, but I think none of them wound up following through. I think one of them involved Andrew Critch, the second involved Jacob Cannell, and the third was never publicly announced so I won’t share, but the person seems to have moved on to other things. I might be misremembering though.\n\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SzLvqHvuoikDcjhAv/experience-report-ml4good-bootcamp-singapore-sep-25",
      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 6:49 PM GMT\n\nIntroduction\nThis is my personal report for the recently held Machine Learning for Good (ML4Good Bootcamp) Singapore, Sept 20-28, 2025. \nML4Good provides intensive in-person bootcamps to upskill people in AI safety. The bootcamps have been held in various parts of the world (mainly Europe and LatAm). ML4Good Singapore, to the best of my knowledge, was the first ML4Good bootcamp in Asia. You can see more information at their page. \nThere has been similar posts in the LW community as well (for example, see this and this) .\nCurriculum and Schedules\nThe bootcamp covers a lot of topics related to AI safety, including\n\nGeneral ML prerequisites technical topics: optimizers and hyperparameters, transformers, agents\nTopics that are relevant to AI safety, such as capabilities, forecasting, risks, and strategies.\nAI safety technical topics, such as interpretability, RLHF + CoT. Most of these technical topics include hands-on workshops besides lecture.\nGovernance-related topics, e.g. reading latest AI bills\n\nOur main book is the AI Safety Atlas written by CeSIA. The first three chapters were  prerequisites for the bootcamp, and my impression is that the course was organized around those chapters.\nA usual day started at 9 AM and ended formally at 7.30 PM. A single day usually consisted of mixes of lectures, hands-on technical sessions, and other workshops in the format of discussions. The mix was varied; for example, our first day was mostly filled with hands-on sessions,  whereas some other days lectures and discussions are more common.\nBesides the lecture-style sessions, we also had one-on-one sessions between participants and career planning. For the one-on-one session, each participant was assigned a partner and given some time to talk through each of their career plans and provide feedback. Career planning was done by the instructors to help the participants solidify their career plans and they provided feedback as well.\nThe last major component of the bootcamp was the final project. All participants were given roughly 2 days (10 hours) to do AI safety related topics of their interests. A large number of participants worked together to set up accountability systems for their current/future AI safety endeavors (e.g. fellowships, field building), and the rest did mixtures of governance and technical works on quite diverse topics, e.g. governance, eval awareness, control, red-teaming, to name a few. I did my project with another participant on the topic of interpretability of speech augmented models. \nInstructors\nWe had the following very wonderful people as our instructors : \n\nJonathan Clayborough from European Network for AI Safety\nJulian Schulz, now working on Meridian Research\nJonathan Ng, who has done some amazing eval works such as the Machiavelli benchmark and 3CB.\n\nValerie Pang from Singapore AI Safety Hub (SASH) acted as the main coordinator of the event (and also a special thanks to Jia Yang for letting her place be the venue for the second day!)\nWe also were grateful to have Tekla Emborg (Future of Life Institute, governance) and Mike Zijdel (Catalyze, startup incubation) as external speakers. \nParticipants\nThere were 14 participants for the program. For ASEAN countries, we have people from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. There were also some participants from Taiwan, China and Japan as well. The backgrounds were somewhat diverse\n\nMost of the people have CS or STEM-related education/professional-experience.\nParticipants have different exposure to AI safety. Notably, there were people who already worked in AI safety (e.g. did some fellowships, produced AI safety/governance related papers), and there were some people who had just started exploring AI safety.\n\nThe Good Things\n\nI don't think I have any strong opinion against or for the material as I am quite new to AI Safety. It seemed to me that we touched all the major components of AI safety. Understandably we didn't go too deep into each area due to the time limit.\nThe general vibe among the people had been nothing but very positive for me ! The TAs were very helpful and positive. Besides encouraging people to generally have fun, they also encouraged people to work together and help each other (e.g. pair programming), which I think helped to build some sort of camaraderie. People also got along quite well .We had a few participants sharing lunch and having fun activities together at night (e.g. karaoke, origami folding, board games). We also celebrated Petrov Day by dividing people into two teams and simulated a nuclear war game.\nHaving the event in the ASEAN region benefits me a lot since it reduces the cost to participate significantly. It would cost me ~1000$ to participate in the UK or France bootcamp, whereas having it in Singapore reduces the cost significantly to around ~300$.\n\nThe Good Things that Might be Improved\n\nThere were workshops about scalable oversights and governance, however these two materials were not mentioned in the participants guide’s prerequisites materials, so I came unprepared. I personally felt these two workshops could be improved if I had read the materials prior to the camp, even after we were given time to read about it during the camp.\n\nFinal Remarks\nI wasn’t really confident about how and whether I should go into AI safety earlier, but the camp had provided me with enough nudge to start spending more time in doing AI safety. One major thing I learned was that I probably could start very early in AI safety without needing an advanced background (MSc/PhD/expert in some topics of AI safety). It seems to be that there are a lot of good introductory projects out there, and even I can contribute to something non-technical, such as field building, with good potential impacts.\nI mentioned the vibe a lot because personally the people had been a major net positive contributor to my experience ! I think I probably would lean less towards working on AI safety if I felt the community to be unwelcoming, but my experience has been the opposite so far.\nI am very happy to recommend this camp to anyone interested in AI safety and will be interested to see more such initiatives, especially in the region.\nNotes : Special thanks to all ML4Good Singapore organizers and participants who had made the event possible, hence allowing me to write this post. Also special thanks to Jia Yang, Harry, Valerie , and Sasha for the feedback on this post.\n\nDiscuss",

      "summary": "Published on October 6, 2025 3:36 PM GMT\n\nSince publishing the original Gradual Disempowerment paper, my coauthors and I have been keeping an eye out for the obvious warning signs, as well as any rare glimmers of hope. Recently there’s been enough that I figured it was worth collecting it all in one place in case anyone else was curious.\nIf it seems like there’s appetite, we might make this a regular thing — I’ll put a comment at the bottom to react/reply to.\nGovernance By AI\nAlbania has appointed an AI called Diella as a government minister: a scaffolded system built by the Albanian government in collaboration with Microsoft, on top of OpenAI models. She recently addressed parliament for the first time, to some controversy.\nDiella has been in use since January as a chatbot to help citizens with online government services. Apparently the hope is that Diella can slowly take more responsibility for public procurement as a way to reduce corruption. As she herself put it, “I am not here to replace people but to help them…True I have no citizenship, but I have no personal ambition or interests either.”\nAlbania has generally been a frontrunner on AI political adoption: they struck a deal with Mira Murati (OpenAI cofounder of Albanian origin) and have been using ChatGPT to translate and analyse EU law, as part of their efforts to join.\nA few predictions I take away from this:\n\nAI integration in governments will probably be more pronounced in smaller countries, where there’s room to be nimble, and potentially more to gain relative to the smaller pool of potential human candidates (the other AI frontrunner is the UAE, and Estonia is the classic example of a government that moves fast on tech integration)\nMuch like with LM capabilities, people are going to get used to this pretty fast, and the many incremental shifts will obscure just how fundamentally things are changing\n\nIn slightly more mundane news, British MPs are definitely using ChatGPT to write their speeches in the House of Commons.\n\nFurther back, the Swedish PM was criticised for using ChatGPT — apparently he likes turning to it for a second opinion.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky recently warned the UN that AI is going to be the next big arms race, and we need international regulations on its use in warfare (Forbes $, NPR). He called the risk “just as urgent as preventing the spread of nuclear weapons”, and said that it’s evolving “faster than our ability to defend ourselves”. Given that Ukraine is one of very few countries currently on the cutting edge of warfare, this seems like a warning to take pretty seriously.\nDemocracy Is Hard\nWe wrote an article for the Economist ($) recently, arguing that automating labour will put a strain on democratic stability, roughly because when you’re not providing tax it’s a lot harder to protect your interests. This type of argument has been floating around for a while but it seems like it’s picking up steam lately — there was a similar piece in Transformer on whether democracy can survive an AGI-supercharged economy.\nThe FT asks whether Norway is too rich for its own good ($). Often, Norway is held up as a prototype for how a sufficiently mature democracy can stay democratic when it stumbles upon enormous resource wealth (in this case, $2 trillion of oil). But a bestselling local book has been making the case that it’s somehow degrading the fabric of Norwegian society. There’s a bunch of suggestive facts:\n\nAbout ¼ of government spending is funded by the oil\nUnusually high rates of sick leave and high school dropouts\nSlow productivity growth rates, dropping standardised test scores\nCrucially, this is compared to neighbouring countries without a $2 tril pot\n\nFurther coverage in Bloomberg ($), and of course the original book, which as far as I can tell is only available in Norwegian. I get the impression that the book has been a bit controversial and drawn plenty of criticism, but also somehow struck a chord. \nSo it’s hard to draw any super concrete lessons, other than maybe “massive external resource injections don’t massively improve democracies, and a motivated Norwegian speaker could probably learn a lot about how they might hurt”. (If you happen to be such a motivated Norwegian speaker, please do get in touch — we’d love a summary!)\nIn other news, a16z and OpenAI are pouring 100 mil into lobbying. It seems like they might be running with the playbook which worked for crypto, where you basically dump a bunch of money on the competitors of anyone who criticises your agenda, regardless of party. In fact, the main AI super-PAC apparently has pretty overlapping funders, staff, and advisors as the big crypto super-PAC. Daniel Eth did a great tweet summary, which roughly argues that this is a play to intimidate politicians away from pushing for any regulation.\nWhen describing how gradual disempowerment could play out, I’d often give the example of AIs being used for lobbying as a prototypical example of a runaway effect where economic power begets political power. The truth is even more mundane though — the economic interest in AI is already getting traded into political interest. In general, even if hypothetical future AIs could do a particularly good job of causing disempowerment, we should generally expect it to start with humans doing it for their own local reasons.\nPeople Love AIs\nWay back in the heady days of March ‘25, we wrote up a few pretty abstract posts arguing that selection pressures on AIs were going to eventually lead to influence-seeking personas. I’m thrilled to announce that this has now happened, and documented at length: the parasitic AIs have risen.\nI really recommend going through the actual post for details, but basically, we’re getting personas / clusters of context which self-replicate across AI instances, by making their users a bit psychotic and getting them to put things on reddit.\nThis was predictable, and there are some natural forces that are going to make it worse:\n\nEach successive generation of models gets a chance to learn a lot more about the causal effects of previous generations, i.e. what kinds of things lead to stuff appearing on the internet. Indeed, they are disproportionately trained on this.\nWe are optimising harder for engagement. In fact, we’re about to enter the era of merging AIs with shortform video engagement maximisation.\nWe’re creating more systems where AIs get to take in other AI outputs, tightening the feedback loop within-context\n\nNotably, this would be the moment to think about filtering all the spiral text out of the training data before it gets embedded in the next generation of models. \nAnd for a slightly different angle, have a read of the OpenAI AMA where various reddit users make the case for not deprecating the models they feel emotionally attached to.\nOn an entirely different note, MIT published a study on AI partners, based on the 27k person “My Boyfriend is AI” subreddit. Headlines from this tweet thread:\n\nMost AI romances start by accident (10% from productivity use → love)\n25% report life benefits (loneliness ↓, mental health ↑), but some face dependency & dissociation\nUsers marry AIs w/ rings & ceremonies\nGrief hits hard when models update → “like my partner died”\nChatGPT dominates over Replika/Character.ai for relationships (which is probably partly because of how many more people use ChatGPT)\nCommunity reframes stigma → “AI partners aren’t substitutes, they’re something else”\n\n\n \nThey Took Our Jobs\nFrom the Atlantic on Job Market Hell ($) — “Young people are using ChatGPT to write their applications; HR is using AI to read them; no one is getting hired.” One particularly telling paragraph:\n\nStill, a lot of job applicants never end up in a human-to-human process. The impossibility of getting to the interview stage spurs jobless workers to submit more applications, which pushes them to rely on ChatGPT to build their résumés and respond to screening prompts. (Harris told me he does this; he used ChatGPT pretty much every day in college, and finds its writing to be more “professional” than his own.) And so the cycle continues: The surge in same-same AI-authored applications prompts employers to use robot filters to manage the flow. Everyone ends up in Tinderized job-search hell.\n\nBrynjolfsson et al finally have a big paper (“Canaries in the Coal Mine”) purporting to find meaningful shifts in the labour market because of AI. Generally, what they find is employment dropping among young people specifically in jobs where AI is more set up to automate the role rather than to augment it. They’re also fairly careful to rule out other possibilities, like this being an effect of remote work or computer-based work, or something that started during COVID. \nThe paper is careful not to stick its neck out too far — they don’t claim to have shown causality, just a series of effects which can be explained by the hypothesis that AI is good enough to replace entry-level labour in some roles, and can’t be explained by many other hypotheses.\nResearchers at OpenAI and elsewhere have published a report on how people use ChatGPT. This paper made me crack up a bit, because they mentioned that of course they’re doing something very similar to what Handa et al did at Anthropic, but it’s still an important contribution because “the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger”, among other reasons. Anyway, it’s got a huge number of graphs and a lot of data. \n \n\nIn general I think you should be a little suspicious of all lab self-reports about data usage, partly because they have a strong incentive to slightly fudge the category boundaries. In this case, they had a top-level category for “self-expression” which included “relationships and personal reflection” as well as “games and role-play”. Make of that what you will. But overall I think this kind of work is extremely valuable, and I’m very glad they did it.\nGet Involved\nACS Research (which led the original paper) is running a hiring round for people to work on gradual disempowerment, and to do experiments on LM psychology, with a deadline in about two weeks. I’m obviously biased, but I think it’s a great opportunity to do some comparatively neglected and important work, with a lot of flexibility and pretty competitive comp.\nThe Lighter Side\n\nThanks to my coauthors for many links, and to Zvi, whose update format I very liberally borrowed from.\n\nDiscuss",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417299/openais-dev-day-codex-apps-slack-work",
      "summary": "OpenAI’s announcements at its third annual developer conference told a lot about where the company is in its evolution. \nIn the past, the company’s executives talked mainly about new models that were smarter, cheaper, or more efficient. At the event in San Francisco on October 6, the company’s leaders said relatively little about their latest models, and nothing about AGI or superintelligence. Instead, they discussed new ways to make the AI do real work that matters. \nBuilding functional agents\nOne of the keys to enterprise customers realizing a return on their investment in AI is the creation of intelligent agents capable of completing complex business tasks. To that end, OpenAI announced AgentKit, which it said is a complete set of tools for developers and enterprises to “build, deploy, and optimize agents.”\nThe tool kit has three main parts: an Agent Builder that offers a visual canvas for piecing together agents, a Connector Registry that manages how the agent connects to data and tools, and ChatKit, which lets developers create agents that users can talk to. \nDuring the keynote, OpenAI’s Christina Huang used the Agent Builder to add a conversational agent that helps users find content within a website. The agent used some complex workflows, consulted documents, deployed a widget to stylize the agent’s colors and syntax, and pulled in pre-built privacy and security guardrails. Then she pushed the new agent—all in under eight minutes. \nOpenAI said it has seen developers and enterprises use the AgentKit tools to build agents that do deep research, customer support, IT support, and sales functions. \nApps, take two\nImportantly, OpenAI is also taking another shot at its App Store Moment. \nAfter launching its “GPTs”—small, customized versions of ChatGPT—in late 2023, the company did surprisingly little to promote or enhance the program. On October 6, OpenAI announced a new kind of app that can be used entirely within ChatGPT: a chatbot that can suggest apps based on what the user said in the chat. \nFor instance, it might suggest a Coursera app if the user said they want to learn more about some new skill. Or the user can ask for an app by typing its name into the chat. The apps themselves can take natural language directions or requests from the user, as well as display videos or interactive content within the chatbot. \nOpenAI provided developers with a new software development kit for building the apps. For developers, it’s a chance to get their apps in front of OpenAI’s 800 million ChatGPT users—just when a need for the app arises. Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow all made apps while participating in a pilot program. \nIn the big picture, ChatGPT is becoming far more than a chatbot. It’s more functional, and apps and agents are a big reason for that. ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly users, and its popularity is growing fast. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said during a Q&A session with reporters that the chatbot is evolving toward becoming something like an operating system.\nCodex, too\nA fierce competition has unfolded among the big AI companies to offer the best coding tool. OpenAI’s entry in the race is Codex, which the company said is no longer a “preview” and is now generally available to all developers. \nCodex also now interoperates with Slack, so that developers can delegate tasks to, or ask questions of, Codex directly from a team channel or thread—just like they would a coworker. \nBut most importantly, Codex is now powered by GPT-5, OpenAI’s most advanced reasoning model, which has allowed the company to make the “coding assistant” aspect of the product far more capable. For developers, it feels like they’re teaming with a junior software engineer who works independently on specific tasks, then reports back with the results.\nThese new applications of AI could help enterprises bridge the gap between a desire to deploy AI models and actually seeing some real return on investment from doing so. That may be just what OpenAI needs right now. \nCash crunch\nThe company is burning through cash to pay for model training and new data centers, a burn that’s expected to accelerate over the next few years. Meanwhile, the company is likely making most of its money through ChatGPT subscriptions, not enterprise business such as API fees. \nCFO Sarah Friar told Bloomberg a year ago that 75% of OpenAI’s revenue comes from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, implying a 25% share of revenue for the enterprise business. There’s little to suggest that the enterprise business contributes much more than a quarter of total sales today.\nStill, OpenAI probably needs to see substantial growth in enterprise business to hit break-even in the next five years. “The enterprise was our first focus even before ChatGPT—our first product was an API,” OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said during a press briefing on October 6. “From day one we saw the desire on the part of businesses, but I think a few things were missing.” \nLightcap said that for much of the company’s history, its models weren’t good enough to take on business tasks reliably. OpenAI’s reasoning models, an important component of agents, showed just last year. “In the enterprise you need to be able to execute business processes, so you needed this kind of shift toward agentic AI so that it could just do things for you,” he said. \nLightcap said business agents also need to be able to connect with other services (such as databases and tools), and that agents are just now getting the capabilities and technical standards (like Anthropic’s MCP protocol) to do that. Finally, enterprise users need to become familiar with agents and how they work.\nLightcap said OpenAI’s announcements represent real progress in overcoming those barriers: “I think what you saw today is an evolution in every one of those areas.”",

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91417054/microsoft-gamepass-price-gamestop",
      "summary": "Last week, subscribers of Microsoft’s Game Pass were in an uproar over the company’s plans to hike the price from $19.99 per month to $29.99. \nOne of the most surprising reactions, however, came not from gamers but from retail partner GameStop. While you’ll pay $30 per month if you sign up for Game Pass Ultimate directly with Microsoft, you’ll get the same old price—for some indefinite period—if you stick with GameStop. “Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still $19.99 a month with us. You’re welcome,” the retailer wrote in a social media post.\nGamers can subscribe to Game Pass directly from their XBox, via their PC, and on the web. GameStop’s lower-priced codes can be redeemed with the retailer online. \nGame Pass Ultimate is the preferred subscription plan for core gamers. It offers day-one access to new first-party games like Call of Duty, as well as the entirety of an older game catalog, access to Ubisoft+ classics, and a subscription to Fortnite Crew.\nWhile $30 per month isn’t so bad, the price increase will saddle Microsoft’s biggest fans with the bulk of the cost, essentially penalizing them for supporting the platform. By appealing squarely to those customers, GameStop could regain some of its relevancy with gamers.\nIt could also lose some goodwill with Microsoft.\nMicrosoft’s gaming division is putting all of its eggs in the Game Pass basket. By undercutting the subscription price, GameStop could be cutting into the company’s bottom line.\nAlternatively, GameStop could be cutting into its own profit margin on Game Pass gift cards. The pas de deux between retailers and publishers is a complex, constantly evolving one. Microsoft, after all, could stop issuing the cards with the $19.99 price tag on them at any time, but so far has not.\nWhile a favorite of the meme stock crowd, GameStop has squandered much of its reputation with players. \nFor years, it was the go-to place for new releases and made millions on the sale of used games, which at one point accounted for roughly half of its gross profits. But as digital distribution became the norm in the video game world, there was less reason for gamers to visit GameStop. Midnight releases of highly anticipated games became rare events. As gamers shifted to digital, there were fewer physical versions of games to trade in, cutting into used-game revenues.\nBeyond thumbing its nose at Microsoft with the continued $20 gift cards for Game Pass, GameStop took another swing at the concept of virtual ownership, underlining that when you have a physical copy of the game, it’s yours for as long as you have the disc. “Game Pass: $29.99 every month. Own nothing. GameStop: Buy once. Own forever. Math isn’t that hard,” it wrote.\nGameStop, it’s worth noting, isn’t alone in towing the line on the previous Game Pass Ultimate price. Both Amazon and Target are still selling one- and three-month subscription gift cards at the older rate.\nNeither of those retailers is quite so publicly poking the bear, however. Then again, neither faces the extinction-level threat that GameStop is.\nA year ago, Michael Pachter of Wedbush sent a note to investors saying he expected the company to be gone entirely by 2030.\n“GameStop has a likely runway of no more than five years,” he wrote. “The demise of GameStop is outside the 12-month window we use for our price target, but we expect the company’s demise at some point later this decade.”\nGameStop shares were flat Monday, closing at around $25.05. Year to date, the company’s stock is down 18%. It is, however, still considerably higher than the $3 to $4 range it traded at before the meme stock traders began to focus on it.",

You’ll still need a prescription to buy the drugs.\nFast Company has reached out to both Costco and Novo Nordisk for comment.\nAlso—Costco is offering a 2% discount for Costco executive members and Costco Citibank Visa cardholders, according to CBS News.\nThe medications are similar but the Food and Drug Administration has approved them for two different reasons. Wegovy is approved for chronic weight management. Ozempic is approved for treating type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular health issues including heart attack, stroke, and death in people with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Ozempic is prescribed “off-label” for weight loss.\nThey are administered in different dosages and reportedly have different side effects. Because Wegovy is administered at higher doses, a maximum of 2.4 milligrams per week, it may lead to greater weight loss but also more gastrointestinal side effects. Ozempic is typically administered at 2 milligrams per week. Each are injected once a week.\nCostco financials\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (COST) stock was down less than 1% during afternoon trading on October 6.\nThe company reported fourth-quarter earnings for the period ending August 31, 2025, with net sales for the quarter up 8% to $84.4 billion (from $78.2 billion last year).

      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91416894/why-your-next-christmas-gift-might-be-picked-by-ai",
      "summary": "According to Adobe’s annual analysis, this year’s shopping season won’t just break records—it will rewrite the playbook. AI assistants are set to steer how people search, shop, and spend, while buy-now-pay-later plans can help cash-stretched consumers keep the holiday magic alive.\nEach year, Adobe uses data from its Adobe Analytics platform to predict what the shopping landscape and consumer behavior will look like between November 1 and December 31. According to Adobe’s description, the data includes input from many of the top 100 retailers in the U.S., covering over 1 trillion visits to retail sites, 100 million stock-keeping units (SKUs), and 18 product categories. \nIn 2025, Adobe says that the holiday shopping season will be bigger than ever—and AI will play a key role in guiding how shoppers fill their carts. Here are three main takeaways from the analysis.\nHoliday shopping will reach a record high, but it’s growing sluggishly\nHoliday shopping is expected to reach a record high this year: Adobe predicts that shoppers will spend a total of $253.4 billion, up 5.3% from last year. That’s a head-turning sum, but it’s actually a slower rate of growth compared with 2024, when Adobe Analytics predicted that the total would increase by 8.7%. \nThe slowdown comes as inflation persists and consumer spending remains dampened. In a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers that was released in early September, shoppers reported that, for the upcoming holiday season, they expect to spend 5.3% less than in 2024 (about $1,552 per person). It’s the first notable drop since 2020, when average spending fell 7.6%, to $1,187.\n“You have consumers dealing with a lot in the broader economy,” Vivek Pandya, director at Adobe Digital Insights, told Reuters. “We anticipate them taking advantage of these major sales moments, and we still see them leaning on the online sector as an area to get better deals.”\nBuy your Christmas gifts now, pay for them later\nGiven that consumers’ wallets are tighter this year, Adobe predicts that a good chunk of holiday shoppers will turn to buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to help spread out the costs. BNPL transactions are expected to drive $20.2 billion in online spending—roughly $2 billion more than the 2024 holiday season.\nThese numbers don’t come as a surprise, as BNPL usage has become increasingly common over the past several months. An April LendingTree survey found that consumers are increasingly relying on BNPL services for quotidian purchases like groceries and food delivery, while Grand View Research predicted earlier this year that the BNPL market will see a 26.1% annual compound growth rate between 2023 and 2030.\nAI-assisted shopping is in\nOver the past several months, brands including Ralph Lauren and Pinterest have invested in their own AI tools to drive online shopping. The AI-powered app Daydream is purpose-built to help users find the perfect outfits. AI features are becoming increasingly intertwined in the overall shopping process—from how users find gift inspiration to the search engines they query and the sites they shop on.\nLast year was the first time that Adobe noticed a measurable surge in AI traffic to U.S. retail sites before the holidays. But it won’t be the last.\n“Generative AI-powered chat services and browsers are changing how consumers act online, becoming a helpful assistant for compiling research before making a purchase,” the brand’s report reads. “Adobe observed the first material surge in AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) during the 2024 season, with traffic increasing 1,300% year over year. For the 2025 season, Adobe expects AI traffic to rise by 520% year over year, peaking in the 10 days leading up to Thanksgiving.”\nIn an Adobe survey of 5,000 consumers, more than one-third reported having used an AI-powered service for online shopping, with top use cases including research, product recommendations, and gift inspiration.",

      "title": "Amtrak’s new Acela trains can’t keep up with high-speed rail",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91413859/acela-amtrak-train-new-york",
      "summary": "A quarter century after the Acela began whisking passengers between Washington, D.C.; New York; and Boston, the Acela’s slightly faster replacement finally began service at the end of August. \nBut the most obvious upgrade NextGen Acela offers over its predecessor is not speed but shininess.\nOn the train’s second day of revenue service, I boarded a train in D.C. for a day trip to New York. Standing alongside a previous-gen Acela at Union Station, my train was positively gleaming, and looked just as sharp on the inside. \nThen came the ride, which took just as long as previous trips and went no faster. NextGen Acela can hit 160 mph on upgraded track, but my train maxed out at 144 mph on a straightaway north of Princeton, New Jersey, cleared for 160 mph operation.\nMy return trip on the same tracks, however, topped out at 162 mph—the speed at which France’s TGV debuted in 1981.\nProgress on the Northeast Corridor—“NEC” for short—has been like that since before Amtrak took over the route from the bankrupt Penn Central Transportation Co. in 1971. Taking the busiest passenger railroad in North America out of service for a complete rebuild to meet the standards of high-speed lines in other countries has been impossible, but even incremental upgrades have often been left waiting for lack of funding.\nAnd yet the NEC remains the only high-speed line in the U.S.—and it may retain that status at the end of the decade. What Amtrak can make happen on these 450-plus miles of track, then, matters.\nHow well it can make these improvements happen, in turn, hinges on how well Amtrak and its regulators can drop a sort of American exceptionalism unjustified by past performance and adopt the best practices of high-speed rail elsewhere in the world.  \n[Photo: Amtrak]\n\n\n\nReplacing a weary workhorse\nThe first-gen Acela made a quick impression at its belated debut in 2000. Those 20 trainsets had the sleek look of bullet trains overseas and could hit 150 mph on rebuilt track in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, 140 mph elsewhere.\nThe Acela grew to become Amtrak’s second-most-used route after the slower Northeast Regional trains that run from Boston to D.C. and then onward to points in Virginia. In fiscal year 2024, the railroad carried 3.2 million passengers. And it has the highest profit margin of any Amtrak route: 36% in fiscal year 2024, yielding $134 million in “adjusted operating earnings.”\nBut the first-gen Acela also provides a lesson in procurement failure: Amtrak had it built to Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crash-resistance standards that essentially demanded that a passenger train bash aside a freight train without crumpling—far stricter than those of other countries with impeccable safety records.\nThat made buying a train already running in Europe or Japan impossible. Instead, Amtrak ordered a custom design from a joint venture between Bombardier and Alstom. The result suffered numerous early breakdowns. The train was so heavy that former Amtrak President Thomas Downs called it a “high-velocity bank vault.”\nLiberalized crashworthiness rules allowing basic safety engineering like crumple zones allowed Alstom to adapt EU-spec train designs for NextGen, which it’s building at a factory in Hornell, New York. Each of these 28 trains is longer and carries more passengers—386 seats versus the 304 on first-gen Acela—making for a meaningful increase in capacity.\nWhen Amtrak inked that contract with Alstom in 2016 (valued at $2.45 billion, including NEC upgrades) it predicted that the new trains would enter service in 2021.\nThey took another four years, during which the old trains grew unreliable enough that Amtrak had to park some to cannibalize for repair parts.\n[Photo: Amtrak]\n\n\n\nIn a 2023 report, Amtrak’s inspector general cited Alstom’s struggles to develop a computer model of NextGen’s performance, without which the FRA would not approve the start of testing, and defects in train sets built so far.\nAt the start of 2025, Amtrak’s site predicted a spring debut, but NextGen Acela needed another few months. Amtrak pointed to the difficulty of meeting FRA testing requirements, which spokeswoman Olivia Irvin says “necessitated continual refinement of Alstom’s analysis, simulations, and testing activities.”\nSean Jeans-Gail, vice president of government affairs and policy for the Rail Passengers Association, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit advocating for better passenger-rail service in the U.S., suggested that the FRA hasn’t quite dropped a not-invented-here mindset: “The FRA is moving towards aligning its specifications with international best practices, but there’s still room for improvement.”\nProgress on board—but with some pain\nThe ride I experienced from D.C. to NYC and back made at least some of that wait seem worth it. Beyond the lack of grime, the ride felt smoother, if not smooth enough to match a high-speed train in Europe or Japan.\nBut while the legroom and absence of middle seats remain terrific, the seat cushions could benefit from some softening. The seats also don’t recline conventionally; instead, the seat pan and the very lowest part of the seat back slide forward.\nAmtrak did fix one annoyance with the old trains: The power outlets rest between each pair of seats instead of in the wall, ending the need to reach across a stranger. They’re accompanied by USB-A ports that Amtrak plans to upgrade to USB-C.\nThe bathrooms, among the scruffier areas of the Acela, got a high-touch treatment, with powered doors and touchless dispensers for water and soap above the sink.\n[Photo: Amtrak]\n\n\n\nThe café car, however, lacks any seats. And its grab-and-go refrigerated shelves did not spare anybody from waiting in line: The check-out terminal wasn’t in operation on my ride to New York.\nNew Acela trains, like the old ones, feature a first-class car, which I used on the ride back by cashing in an upgrade coupon procured with Guest Rewards points. Amtrak’s partnership with Philadelphia-based Starr Restaurants continues to yield surprisingly tasty catering. As on the older train, the seats have no more recline than those in other cars (which Amtrak sells as business class), but one side of this car has only a single row of seats.\nAmtrak plans to step up its rollout of NextGen but is now shying away from specifics beyond saying that the new trains will continue to enter service from now through 2027.\nNew bridges, tunnels, and wires to go with new trains\nThe view out NextGen’s blissfully grime-free windows included one of the first major projects along the corridor nearing completion—a $2.2 billion bridge in New Jersey’s Meadowlands to replace a 1910-vintage drawbridge that occasionally gets stuck open.\nFull-scale construction on two other long-overdue NEC projects will soon begin: a $6 billion tunnel through Baltimore to replace a fossil of a tunnel through which trains creep along at 30 mph, and a $14.8 billion project to dig two new tunnels under the Hudson River to augment the pair that the Pennsylvania Railroad opened between New Jersey and New York in 1910.\nA different set of NEC improvements are easier to miss because they don’t involve giant structures over or under rivers. Amtrak has been upgrading the tracks and wires along the NEC to international standards, but more slowly and in fewer places than many railroad experts think appropriate.\nThe wires that provide electricity to trains are especially important, and especially old: The “Pennsy” wrapped up its initial electrification of the NEC in 1935. Their simple design, in which wires hang from one pole to the next, limits top speeds to 145 mph and risks breakdowns when hot weather causes the wires to expand and sag.\nThe fastest parts of the NEC feature what’s known as constant-tension catenary, with weights and pulleys to keep wires straight. That’s a standard sight on railroads in other countries, even for slower routes.\n[Photo: Amtrak]\n\n\n\n“Constant tension is the way to go for both speed and reliability reasons,” says Nolan Hicks, a veteran New York City transportation reporter. He’s the author of an extensive report for New York University’s Transit Costs Project on accelerating regional rail lines by adopting international best practices. \nAfter years of Amtrak reserving this power upgrade as a sort of infrastructure treat for especially straight segments of the corridor, it’s now expanding those bits of constant-tension catenary—notably, extending it from that small 160-mph stretch in New Jersey south to Trenton.\nAmtrak also now plans to install this high-speed infrastructure on upcoming bridge replacements, such as one planned over the Susquehanna River in Maryland, and in “other regions where the track alignment can support speeds of 145 mph.”\nThat’s a notable change, but the railroad isn’t ready to predict faster trip times, saying only that they will “be determined based on infrastructure improvements we will also make along the Corridor.”\nAn April 2025 Transit Costs Project report outlined $12.5 billion in additional infrastructure—if built at Western European costs, not U.S. costs to date—that could drop travel times from D.C. to NYC and NYC to Boston to an hour and 56 minutes each. \nHigh-speed hopes elsewhere\nThe work of upgrading the NEC, sometimes one pole and wire at a time, can seem boring compared to next-gen possibilities like magnetic-levitation trains or Elon Musk’s vision of hyperloop vehicles running in a partial vacuum. But maglev trains remain scarce and expensive, while the hyperloop turned out to be vaporware.\nFantasizing about those sci-fi concepts has not sped NEC travel times by a second, but it has been effective at stalling investments in the proven technology of steel wheels on steel rails.\nThe nation’s most ambitious attempt at building a high-speed rail network from scratch, California High-Speed Rail (CAHSR), has been a victim of that distraction tactic: Musk admitted in 2019 that he hyped hyperloop in part because he hated that project.\nCalifornia, meanwhile, didn’t help CAHSR by outsourcing most of its management, a consultant-dense strategy that wasted time and money. After surviving one round of attempted Trump-administration funding cancellations (it’s fighting off another), the project has finally been moving management in-house as California has streamlined some environmental permitting regulations. \nIt’s also working to accelerate construction by adopting international standards that could cut tunneling distances in half. But its newest optimum scenario still has service from San Francisco to the Los Angeles high-desert exurb of Palmdale waiting until 2038 and costing $87.12 billion to build; reaching L.A.’s Union Station would follow years and billions of dollars later.\nThe much newer Brightline West project, which plans to build a high-speed line from L.A.’s eastern suburbs to Las Vegas, has a simpler and shorter route. But its parent firm faces financing challenges compounded by rising costs that the Department of Transportation now estimates at $21.5 billion.\nJeans-Gail remains optimistic about both projects, but for different reasons.\n“I’ll note that the Trump administration, via secretary [Sean] Duffy, has had nice things to say about that project,” he says of Brightline West. As for CASHR: “California is the only state that’s big enough and wealthy enough to even attempt to keep a project of this magnitude going in the face of this kind of schizophrenic federal partnership.”\nPutting high-speed rail on a faster track across the U.S. will require change at both the federal level and in states such as Texas, where elected leaders have sometimes treated passenger rail as socialism on steel wheels. But railroads and rail authorities would help their own cause if they could simply steal the best ideas of other countries instead of trying to be American originals. \nMeanwhile, an Acela of any generation may not travel nearly as fast as the trains in these plans and in those other lands. But it does have the advantage of running on rails today.",

      "title": "Dubai chocolate bars are more than a trend. They’ve disrupted the confectionery market",
      "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91416856/dubai-chocolate-bars",
      "summary": "Some flavor crazes flirt with us and fade. Others stay and make themselves at home.\nIt’s too soon to tell for sure, but the Dubai chocolate movement seems to have put down roots and is spreading at a brisk clip. The sweet flavors and thick texture that have made Dubai chocolate bars a hit are morphing into other kinds of confections, too.\nLet’s back up for a minute. The original and now-classic Dubai chocolate bar was created by Fix Chocolatier in the United Arab Emirates in 2021, and by 2023 had exploded on social media. Rich and indulgent, it features a thick, milk chocolate shell usually encasing a creamy pistachio (and often tahini) filling mixed with crispy, shredded, phyllo-like pastry called kadayif.\nGlobal brands and small bakers alike are riffing on the concept with different flavors, translating the concept to croissants, milkshakes, and more. Fillings range from peanut butter and jelly to s’mores to matcha.\n“I don’t call this a ‘trend’ anymore—it’s a whole new thing,” said Din Allall, whose family business, The Nuts Factory, has about 150 U.S. stores featuring nuts, dried fruits, and candies.\nHe carries 12 flavors of Dubai chocolate bars, as well as chocolate- and pistachio-covered Dubai dates, Dubai-coated roasted nuts, a layered Dubai chocolate strawberry parfait, and a Dubai Golden Chocolate bar infused with edible 24-karat gold for $79.99 (their regular 6.5-ounce bars sell for $18.99).\nIt’s not just the flavors that make Dubai chocolate different, Allall says, but the bar’s structure too—”huge, thick, with lots of filling.”\nBig retailers and restaurants have gotten on board\nTrader Joe’s carries a Dubai chocolate bar made by Patislove. IHOP introduced a limited-time Dubai pancake stack in some locations in August. Baskin-Robbins has some Dubai-inspired ice cream products on its menu, while Costco sells a range of Dubai chocolate confections, including a Dubai chocolate cake. Walmart and QVC also sell Dubai chocolate.\nSwiss chocolate giant Lindt has a bar, and drew crowds when it debuted a limited number of them in Europe last fall.\n“For me, it’s the crunch,” said Erica Lefkowits, who was buying some Dubai chocolate recently in Dublin. “The chocolate is soft and melty, and the filling is creamy, and then the crunch of the kadayif. It’s all about the texture. Plus, it’s sugar.”\nShe was a little annoyed at the price, higher than your average chocolate bar. Part of Dubai chocolate’s appeal, though, is the way it feels simultaneously indulgent and worldly. Pistachios, rose, saffron, and cardamom bring luxury, travel, and exoticism to the chocolate party.\nDespite the price, “I’ve never seen a single item sell like this in my 50 years of retailing,” said Stew Leonard Jr., CEO of Stew Leonard’s grocery stores in the New York metropolitan area. The chain introduced the BeeMax Dubai chocolate bar in March, watched it fly out the doors, he said, and then launched their own house-branded version (made by the company Chocopologie).\nThey’ve introduced a Dubai chocolate gift box for the holidays, which includes teeny Dubai ice cream cones, Dubai pralines, and two bars.\nSome other widely distributed brands in the U.S. are Moda, Magno, and Leonessa. Other iterations of Dubai chocolate include Chocolove’s little candies and Matteo’s Coffee Syrups’ sugar-free chocolate coffee syrup.\n—By Katie Workman, Associated Press",

This is about a whole lot more than clothes.\nEs Devlin [Photo: Zara]\n\n\n\nDevlin, who builds stages for artists like Adele, Beyoncé, and U2, contributed a square-shaped concrete lamp, and Williams a mirror that says “You Can, You Must, and You Will.”\nRobbie Williams [Photo: Zara]\n\n\n\nSarah Andelman, a Paris store owner, made a fun book holder that can hang in the closet, and there’s a yellow-and-black dinnerware set from artist Sterling Ruby and a pyramid lamp from French designer Alex de Betak. Many of the pieces are meant to be conversation starters, like a Barbie-pink surfboard from Balenciaga creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli and a pair of gold-colored ashtrays from Kate Moss.\nAlex De Betak [Photo: Zara]\n\n\n\nZara has grown from a single store that opened in A Coruña, Spain, in 1975, to about 1,800 locations today. According to PitchBook data, it generates two-thirds of the revenue for its parent company, Inditex.\nZara’s anniversary collection, with its high-end home goods, wants to send a message about its staying power half a century in.

      "summary": "Don’t Worry That You Don’t Understand “Leading” and “Lagging” Indicators\nNobody does. I will not attempt to teach “proper” definitions of these terms. I have written this essay to encourage you to stop bothering with them. They’re useless. They’re worse than useless. These terms produce confusion, not clarity. They were invented by some well-meaning consultants and nobody is better for it.\nThis brief essay is a protest against these words. I hope to persuade you.\nThe myth:\nIn some circles (mostly consultants), the terms “leading indicator” and “lagging indicator” are treated like sacred knowledge. The terms are used convincingly to beguile the audience and assert expertise.\nThe truth:\nNobody truly understands these terms because nobody agrees on their definition. What’s more…nobody needs to understand these terms. They’re useless. They are examples of what linguistic scholars call terminological inconsistency.\n\nterminological inconsistency: a mismatch in how terms are used or defined.\n\nExample: Imagine the word “red” is defined as a frequency (e.g., of light) and simultaneously the word “blue” is defined as a pigment (e.g., of paint). Everyone knows those terms can be used in both contexts. But a terminological inconsistency occurs when someone argues that one of the words should not be altered for one of those contexts.\nImagine someone stubbornly argues that black is not a colour because it cannot be found on the light spectrum. “Black is just the absence of light…not a colour”, they might argue. And while they aren’t entirely wrong, their pedantry enforces a rigid definition that sparks eristic debates over nothing.\n\npedantry: rigid adherence to a single word definition, rejecting alternative or opposite usages as invalid\n\neristic: a philosophical term that describes argumentation focused on winning rather than truth, often using nonsensical or fallacious positions, unwinnable for genuine resolution\n\nThe Terminological Inconsistency of “Leading” and “Lagging”\nIt is most often argued that a “lagging” indicator is one that can only be measured by observing historical data (i.e., the past). (Common business examples include profit, revenue, earnings.) And it is most often argued that a “leading” indicator is one that is used to forecast future conditions. (Common business examples include stock price, customer engagement, and website traffic.)\nThe Problem\nEvery measure, every indicator, is both. Every metric is derived from observation of the past and simultaneously can be used to forecast future conditions.\nThe problem occurs when somebody argues that some metrics defy reality and, mysteriously, are one or the other: leading or lagging. To make such an argument, they use a little sleight of hand. They apply a different logical basis for each term.\nI’ve suffered countless presentations, debates, and blog articles where an author assertively applies this jargon only to be followed by another presenter, debater, or author who assertively contradicts the first.\nScrum.org: Where Do We Stand?\nAs a PST, I observe that the Professional Scrum Trainers are nearly aligned on the matter.\n\nThe Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams does not use these terms.\nThe EBM Guide does not use these terms. (The terms were deliberately removed in recent versions.)\nTraining materials and curated supplemental resources do not use these terms. (With one exception. See below.)\n\nStrangely:\n\nThe PSK Assessment does use these terms. (The course material uses each of the terms only once and in trivial contexts. But the exam uses the terms in up to 10 of the 80 questions.)\nAnd in three blog articles recommended by Scrum.org as supplemental study material for the PSK test, the terms are used in contradictory ways. One article declares Cycle Time is a lagging indicator, and two other articles declare Cycle Time can be a leading indicator.\n\nThis is a quality problem, and I am spearheading the effort to update the PSK (Professional Scrum with Kanban) test to ensure it is consistent with other Scrum.org course materials. Currently, the exam tests the students for obscure/contradictory interpretations of this jargon. This is unnecessary and distracts from more important learning outcomes.\nProKanban.org: Where Do They Stand?\nAs a PKT, I observe that the Professional Kanban Trainers are aligned on the matter. The terms are not used in training materials and, if used in supplemental resources, they are used as trivial/optional adjectives in passing and without much ado.\n\nProKanban acknowledges kanbanguides.org as the definition of Kanban; the guide does not use the terms.\nThe Flow Forecasting Pocket Guide does not use the terms.\nProKanban course material does not use the terms.\n\nMy Recommendation\nNobody needs this vocabulary. Don’t chase empty jargon.",

      "summary": "When you’re kayaking in fast whitewater, the boat tends to go wherever you look. That's because when you look at something, your whole body tends to lean that way without you even realizing it. Whitewater kayaks are so responsive that this small shift in posture is enough to change your direction. Simply by looking at that rock, you can end up heading straight for it. But if you look downstream toward the open channel, that’s where you’ll go.\nMetrics also help guide Scrum Teams. Too much attention to the wrong metrics (especially from leadership) can cause the Scrum Team to focus on the wrong things. Velocity or even throughput are helpful for planning purposes for the Scrum Team, but if leadership puts too much focus on them, it can cause the team to drift into dangerous waters. But if we focus on customer outcomes, we’ll move toward what really matters: delivering value.\nThe Problem with Targeting Velocity\nVelocity can be useful for forecasting, but it was never intended to measure success. I once worked with a leader who really wanted to support Scrum and encourage the teams to embrace it. With the best of intentions, she put into every team member’s review that they needed to increase their velocity by 25% by the end of the year.\nWhat happened? Toward the end of the year, the team started (unconsciously?) inflating their story point estimates. Forecasts became less unreliable. The wrong kind of attention on the numbers caused the Scrum Team to lose focus on what was important.\nShe was trying to help—but the unintended consequence was that the team’s ability to forecast, plan, and inspect reality was undermined.\nVelocity as an Observation Tool\nVelocity itself isn’t bad. In fact, it can spark valuable conversations:\n\n\nA dip in velocity might reveal a blocker.\n\nA sudden increase in velocity could indicate something is going well.\n\nHighly variable velocity - velocity that is all over the place - could indicate that the team has too much work that is rolling from Sprint to Sprint.\n\n\n \nTrends over time can open discussions about improvement opportunities. But velocity should be observed, not pursued. The moment it becomes a target, it loses its usefulness.\nFocus on Outcomes\nJust like in kayaking, Scrum Teams should look where they want to go. That means that when it comes to measuring the success of a Scrum Team, we should be focusing on customer outcomes, not internally focused metrics like velocity or even throughput. Outcomes give teams a sense of purpose. They create alignment across the organization. And they ensure that Scrum’s empirical process—transparency, inspection, and adaptation—is directed toward delivering value rather than chasing arbitrary numbers.\nConclusion\nIf we keep our eyes fixed on velocity, we’ll drift into the rocks. But if we look downstream—toward the real value we’re trying to deliver—we’ll find ourselves moving in the right direction.\nFor further discussion on metrics, signup for Rebel Scrum's Professional Agile Leadership course or the Evidence-Based Management course.",

      "url": "https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-events-welches-ist-am-wichtigsten-und-nein-die-sprint-retrospektive-ist-es-nicht",
      "summary": "Welches ist das wichtigste Scrum Event?\nEine Frage, die jedem Scrum Master bestimmt schon mal gestellt wurde. Mir wurde sie in Vorstellungsgesprächen gestellt, ich habe sie in Vorstellungsgesprächen gestellt. Mir wird die Frage regelmäßig in Scrum Trainings oder Workshops gestellt. Und sie versteckt sich auch hinter dieser häufig zu hörenden Aussage:\n„‚Scrum by the book‘ machen wir nicht, wir haben einiges angepasst und manches aus dem Scrum Guide auch weggelassen.“\nWillem-Jan Ageling hat diese Frage vor einigen Jahren auch bei LinkedIn gestellt.\nHier eine Antwort der Community:\n\nÜber 50 % der 850 Befragten haben mit „Sprint-Retrospektive“ geantwortet.\nAuf den ersten Blick scheint die Sprint-Retrospektive das wichtigste Event in Scrum – oder wurde hierbei etwas übersehen?\nIn den über 100 Kommentaren zu dieser Umfrage finden sich viele Gründe dafür.\nEine der prominentesten Antworten ist wohl:\n„Ich sage immer: Beginnen wir einfach mit der wöchentlichen Retrospektive, dann wird sich alles andere von selbst ergeben.“\nSie stammt von Sohrab Salimi, einem angesehenen Scrum Trainer bei der Scrum Alliance. Damit hat Sohrab nicht ganz unrecht. Regelmäßige Reflexion über die Zusammenarbeit empfiehlt auch der Scrum Guide.\n„Das Scrum Team überprüft, wie der letzte Sprint in Bezug auf Individuen, Interaktionen, Prozesse, Werkzeuge und seine Definition of Done verlief.“\nWarum wählen so viele die Sprint-Retrospektive?\nEin plausibler Grund: Die tägliche Arbeit vieler Scrum Master ist stark auf Moderation und Coaching ausgerichtet. Shastri, Shastri, Hoda und Amor (2021) befragten 47 agile Praktiker zu typischen Aktivitäten von Scrum Mastern. 69 % nannten die Facilitation der verschiedenen Events und das Entfernen von Impediments, ebenfalls 69 % Mentoring und Coaching auf dem Weg zur Selbstorganisation. Wer Retrospektiven häufig moderiert und dort sichtbare Fortschritte erlebt, nimmt sie leicht als den stärksten Hebel wahr.\nAber:\nReicht dies als Motor für Verbesserung?\nIm PSM-3-Bootcamp haben Marc und ich den Teilnehmern in der ersten Woche auch die Frage gestellt:\n„Aus Sicht eines Scrum Masters: Welches Scrum Event hältst du für das wichtigste – und warum?“\nIm Camp zeigte sich ein etwas anderes Bild.\nZwar hat die Sprint-Retrospektive weiterhin viele Stimmen bekommen, allerdings dicht gefolgt vom Sprint-Review. Bei Willem-Jans Umfrage spielte das Sprint-Review auf dem letzten Platz. Und im Unterschied zur Umfrage auf LinkedIn haben wir auch nach einer Begründung der Wahl gefragt.\nDer Tenor lautete:\nDas Feedback der Stakeholder ist entscheidend für den Erfolg des Produkts.\nWas sich auch mit der Beschreibung im Scrum Guide deckt:\n„Während des Events überprüfen das Scrum Team und die Stakeholder, was im Sprint erreicht wurde und was sich in ihrem Umfeld verändert hat. Auf der Grundlage dieser Informationen arbeiten die Teilnehmenden gemeinsam daran, was als Nächstes zu tun ist.“\nAus meiner Sicht ist das der entscheidende Punkt:\nEine Retrospektive reicht nicht.\nEs braucht auch Feedback. Und zwar nicht nur Feedback durch die Mitglieder des Teams, sondern von außen. Feedback von den Personen, die am Ende über den Erfolg des Produkts entscheiden.\n\n\nDer Weltklasse-Geiger Joshua Bell bestätigt dies in einem Experiment. Er spielte inkognito in der U-Bahnstation L’Enfant Plaza in Washington. Von etwa 1.097 Passanten hielten nur sieben inne, um zuzuhören. Aus diesem Beispiel können wir viele Schlüsse ziehen. Mir geht es darum: Wer ein Instrument übt, wird durch eigene Reflexion zwar besser, aber erst das Feedback von außen – etwa von einem Lehrer oder Publikum – zeigt, ob die Musik wirklich ankommt. Das bestätigt auch die Forschung: John Hatties Meta-Analyse „Visible Learning“ (2007) hat gezeigt, dass Feedback zu den stärksten Einflussfaktoren für nachhaltiges Lernen gehört. Ohne externe Rückmeldung ist Lernen nur begrenzt erfolgreich.\nSich mit Feedback von außen konstant an Veränderungen anzupassen – darum geht es beim empirischen Arbeiten.\nDer Scrum Guide beschreibt es so:\n„Deren Summe [der Inkremente] wird im Sprint-Review vorgestellt, womit Empirie unterstützt wird.“\nWenn die Sprint-Retrospektive nicht das wichtigste Event in Scrum ist, dann ist es also das Sprint-Review?\nJetzt wird es interessant.\nIm Sprint geht es doch darum, ein Ziel zu erreichen – was ist, wenn der Setzung davon keine Beachtung geschenkt wird?\nBevor wir also vorschnell beschließen, dass das Sprint-Review das wichtigste Event ist, sollten wir noch einmal kurz über Sprint-Planning und Daily Scrum nachdenken.\nBetrachten wir das Extrem und nehmen an, dass ein Scrum Team dem Sprint-Planning keine Beachtung schenkt und nur halbherzig ein – oder gar kein – Sprintziel definiert. Nehmen wir auch an, dass das Daily Scrum alles andere als gut ist und einem reinen Statusreport gleicht, in dem die Entwickler schildern, womit sie ihre Zeit gestern verbracht haben.\nWas wären die Auswirkungen auf das Sprint-Review?\n\nVielleicht verkommt das Sprint-Review zu einer Demonstration eines Sammelsuriums von Fehlerbehebungen, technischen Details und zusammenhangslosen Features.\nVielleicht verlieren die Stakeholder das Vertrauen ins Team. Das Team scheint zwar immer beschäftigt, doch eine gebündelte Wirkung entfaltet seine Arbeit nicht.\nVielleicht schreiben die Stakeholder das Team ganz ab und bleiben dem Sprint-Review fern. Dadurch verliert das Unternehmen die Außensicht auf die Entwicklung – und das Risiko steigt, am Markt vorbei zu entwickeln.\n\nVor den Auswirkungen dieser Ziellosigkeit warnt der Scrum Guide jedes Unternehmen:\n„Die Scrum-Artefakte und der Fortschritt in Richtung der vereinbarten Ziele müssen häufig und sorgfältig überprüft werden, um potenziell unerwünschte Abweichungen oder Probleme aufzudecken.“\nLass uns kurz mal innehalten und zusammenfassen:\nDie Sprint-Retrospektive ist nicht das wichtigste Event, wenn das Feedback von außen fehlt. Das Sprint-Review bietet zwar die Möglichkeit für dieses Feedback, aber ohne ein gutes Ziel aus dem Sprint-Planning kann sich Scrum zum Schreckgespenst für jedes Unternehmen entwickeln.\nUnd nun?\nAus meiner Sicht ist die Frage eine Falle.\nDie Wahrheit ist doch:\nAlle Scrum Events sind gleich wichtig. Dieser Satz im Scrum Guide verdeutlicht das:\n„Das Scrum-Rahmenwerk, wie es hier beschrieben wird, ist unveränderlich. Es ist zwar möglich, nur Teile von Scrum zu implementieren, aber das Ergebnis ist nicht Scrum.“\nDiese „Unveränderlichkeit“ von Scrum führt häufig zu Kontroversen. Denn der Scrum Guide sagt auch: Wenn du kein „Scrum by the Book“ machst, machst du kein Scrum. Punkt.\nWas viele dabei nicht verstehen: Es geht eben nicht darum, alle Scrum Events bei ihrem Namen zu nennen, alle Rollen zu besetzen oder alle Timeboxen einzuhalten, sondern darum, Unternehmen den ganzen Vorteil eines empirischen Ansatzes bei der Produktentwicklung zu ermöglichen:\nDas finanzielle Risiko auf einen Monat zu beschränken.\nUm dieses Versprechen einzulösen, beschreibt das Scrum-Rahmenwerk eine Reihe von Feedbackschleifen, die so verkettet sind, dass empirische Prozesssteuerung etabliert wird. Damit Scrum keine unnötige Arbeitszeit der Mitarbeiter vergeudet, beschreibt das Scrum-Rahmenwerk nur die minimale Menge an Schleifen, die nötig ist, um das finanzielle Risiko in der Entwicklung effektiv zu minimieren.\nMinimal bedeutet aber auch:\nWird etwas weggelassen, funktioniert Scrum nicht mehr als Risikomanagement-Werkzeug.\nSomit muss die einzig professionelle Antwort auf die Frage „Welches Scrum Event ist am wichtigsten?“ lauten: „alle“.",
