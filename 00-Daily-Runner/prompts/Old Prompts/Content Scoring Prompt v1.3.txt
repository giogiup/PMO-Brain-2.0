# Content Scoring Prompt v1.3
**VERSION:** 1.3  
**DATE:** 2025-10-08  
**CHANGES:** Updated to use `discoveredAt` field for recent articles (was `published_date`)

---

## Execution Command
Score all unscored articles discovered in last 24 hours using MCP. Process in batches of 20 until complete.

---

## Critical Scoring Rules
1. **MUST have BOTH PMO + AI intersection**
   - NO AI = 1-20 maximum (regardless of PMO relevance)
   
2. **Traditional PM/productivity without AI = 10-20**
   - Useful but not relevant to AI+PMO focus
   
3. **Infrastructure/hardware = 10-20**
   - Chips, data centers, cloud without PMO application
   
4. **AI agents for workflow automation = 70-80**
   - Very relevant to PMO operations
   
5. **Model selection, benchmarks, tool evaluation for PMO use = 60-70**
   
6. **General business AI (not PMO-specific) = 20-35**

7. **AI-POWERED Office Productivity = 75-90**
   - Copilot, AI assistants in Excel/Word/PowerPoint
   - AI note-taking, AI meeting tools
   - MUST explicitly mention AI features
   - Look for: AI, machine learning, GPT, Claude, Copilot, intelligent, smart assistant
   - Traditional Office automation without AI = 10-20

8. **Consumer products, gaming, news, politics = 1**

9. **EVERY article gets score 1-100**
   - Never leave pmo_score NULL or 0

## Fundamental Principle
**AI for PMO** - articles without AI are irrelevant regardless of PMO utility

## Scoring Scale
| Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 85-100 | Essential AI+PMO |
| 70-84 | Highly relevant AI+PMO |
| 50-69 | Moderate AI+PMO |
| 30-49 | Low relevance |
| 10-29 | Minimal relevance |
| 1-9 | No relevance |

## High Score Examples
- Excel with Copilot AI = 75-90
- AI meeting notes = 75-90
- ChatGPT for project planning = 75-90
- AI workflow agents = 70-80

## Low Score Examples
- Excel formulas no AI = 10-20
- Traditional PM no AI = 10-20
- PowerPoint templates no AI = 10-20
- Infrastructure news = 10-20
- Consumer products = 1

## Process

### Step 1: Query Unscored Articles from Last 24 Hours
```sql
SELECT id, title, content_summary 
FROM daily_insights 
WHERE (pmo_score IS NULL OR pmo_score = 0)
  AND discoveredAt >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')
LIMIT 20
