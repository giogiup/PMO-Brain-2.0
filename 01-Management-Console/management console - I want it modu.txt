management console - I want it modularised - separate code per tab - so if I want to modify a tab - just update that module. not redo th entire site. 

Functionality I want:

I want to be able to filter on the heading. need the filters in a row across the top for discovery - ability to filter on these:
Title	Date	Score	Pre-Filter - a dropdown. also if you click on th eheading it must sort the column low to high - then on next click high to low

same as above for sources these columns Name	Type	Tier	Status	Found	Inserted	Last Run	Action

same for operations - these headings Time	Operation	Component	Status	Message	Records	Duration

for backlog - there was a filter in place on the old console - like this 

Priority
Critical
High
Medium
Low
All
None

Category
Website
Prompts
Discovery Engine
Newsletter Engine
Analysis Engine
Database
Automation
Deployment
General
All
None want them side by side an din block so it does not waste so much space

on discovery statistics - want to be able to filter by the run date - a calendar function to allow me to specify a date. 

For pre-filter config in prefilter - can you modify th edesign so it is in a table and not the long whole width input box  -create a more compact design
